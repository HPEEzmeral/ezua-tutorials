    "# Ride-Sharing\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you explore how to leverage Feast to generate and reuse/share training features, and provide feature\n",
    "consistency/efficiency in near real-time model inference. In this use-case, your goal is to train a ride-sharing driver\n",
    "satisfaction prediction model. Feast addresses several prevalent challenges in this pipeline:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Training-serving skew and complex data joins**: Often, feature values are scattered across multiple tables. Merging\n",
    "   these datasets can be a tedious, time-consuming, and error-prone task. Feast simplifies this process with proven\n",
    "   logic that maintains point-in-time accuracy, preventing future feature values from leaking into your models.\n",
    "1. **Online feature availability**: During inference, models frequently require features that aren't immediately\n",
    "   accessible and must be derived from other data sources. Feast streamlines deployment to a range of online stores,\n",
    "   such as DynamoDB, Redis, and Google Cloud Datastore. It ensures that essential features are always at hand and\n",
    "   updated at the moment of inference.\n",
    "1. **Feature and model versioning**: Within larger organizations, it's common for different teams to inadvertently\n",
    "   duplicate feature creation logic because they can't reuse features from other projects. Plus, models have data\n",
    "   dependencies that demand versioning, like when executing A/B tests on various model iterations. Feast promotes the\n",
    "   discovery and sharing of previously used features and facilitates the versioning of feature groups through feature\n",
    "   services.\n",
    "1. **Feature Transformations**: Feast introduces lightweight feature transformations, empowering users to standardize\n",
    "   transformation logic for both online and offline scenarios and across different models.\n",
