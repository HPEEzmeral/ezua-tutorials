    "# Creating an Inference Service using MLFlow and KServe\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the second part of our tutorial on building a question-answering application over a corpus of private documents using Large Language Models (LLMs). In the previous Notebook, you focused on embedding the documents into a high-dimensional latent space and storing these embeddings in a Vector Store using the Chroma database interface provided by LangChain.\n",

    "In this Notebook, you will be taking the next step in this journey. You will use MLFlow to log the Chroma DB files as artifacts of an experiment. After logging the artifacts, you will then create an Inference Service that retrieves these artifacts and uses them to provide context to user queries. For this purpose, you'll be using KServe, a Kubernetes-based platform that provides a serverless framework for serving machine learning models at scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that since KServe does not support serving Chroma DB files out-of-the-box, you will be using a custom predictor component. This means that you'll need to create a Docker image first, which can then be deployed as our Inference Service. This process allows for a high degree of customization, enabling you to fine-tune your service to your specific needs. You can find the code, as well as the Dockerfile for the custom predictor inside the `vectorstore` directory of this project. However, to save time, you can use the one we have pre-built for you: `gcr.io/mapr-252711/ezua-demos/vectorstore:v0.1.0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you're ready, this Notebook will guide you through the necessary steps for creating a scalable Vector Store service. First, let's import the libraries you'll need:"

    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You've successfully navigated through the process of logging the Chroma DB files as artifacts using MLFlow, creating a custom Docker image, and setting up an Inference Service with KServe that retrieves these artifacts to serve your Vector Store. This Inference Service forms the backbone of our question-answering application, enabling us to efficiently answer queries based on the document embeddings we generated previously.\n",
    "\n",
    "From here, there are two paths you can choose:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Testing the Vector Store Inference Service: If you'd like to test the Vector Store Inference Service that you've just created, you can proceed to our third (optional) Notebook. This Notebook provides a step-by-step guide on how to invoke the Inference Service and validate its performance.\n",
    "- Creating the LLM Inference Service: Alternatively, if you're ready to move on to the next stage of the project, you can jump straight to our fourth Notebook. In this Notebook, we'll guide you through the process of creating an Inference Service for the Large Language Model (LLM), which will work in conjunction with the Vector Store Inference Service to provide answers to user queries."
