    "The approach you will employ involves transforming each document in the corpus into a high-dimensional numerical representation known as an \"embedding\", using a pre-trained Transformer model. This process is sometimes referred to as \"embedding\" the document in a latent space. The latent space here is a high-dimensional space where similar documents are close to each other. The position of a document in this space is determined by the content and the semantic meaning it carries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have these embeddings, we store them in a Vector Store. A Vector Store is an advanced AI-native database designed to hold these high-dimensional vectors and provide efficient search capabilities. This enables us to quickly identify documents in our corpus that are semantically similar to a given query, which will also be represented as a vector in the same latent space.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following cells in this Notebook will guide you through the process of creating such a Vector Store. You will start by generating embeddings for each document, then you will move on to storing these embeddings in a Vector Store and finally, you will see how easy it is to to retrieve documents from the Vector Store based on a query.\n",

For this, you will be using KServe, a flexible, cloud-native platform for serving machine learning models.\n",
