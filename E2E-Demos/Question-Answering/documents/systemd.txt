`systemd` is an init system and system manager for Linux operating systems. It is a collection of programa and libraries, not a single binary. `systemd` is responsible for starting and managing processes on the system, including system services, user programs, and daemons. It provides a standard interface for controlling and interacting with these processes, as well as a number of features to improve the reliability, performance, and management of the system.

`systemd` is designed to be a more modern and flexible alternative to the traditional SysV init system. It has a number of advantages over SysV init, including faster boot times, better dependency management, and support for parallelization of service startups.

`systemd` is now the default init system on many Linux distributions, including popular distributions such as Ubuntu, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, and Fedora. It is widely used in the Linux community and has become the de facto standard for managing processes on Linux systems.
