Linux containers are a powerful technology that allows you to run multiple isolated processes on a single host.

These processes share the hostâ€™s kernel but have their own user space, meaning that they have their own set of libraries, dependencies, and runtime environments. There are three key components that make up a Linux container: namespaces, control groups, and overlay file systems.
