Transistors are semiconductor devices that are used to amplify and switch electronic signals. They were invented in 1947 by William Shockley, John Bardeen, and Walter Brattain at Bell Labs in the United States. William Shockley then moved to Silicon Valley founding Shockley Semiconductor, whose employees later founded Fairchild Semiconductors, whose employees later founded Intel, the world's largest computer chipmakers today.

Transistors consists of two electrodes separated by a material that sometimes can conduct electricity and other times resist. Such a material is called a semiconductor, which is usually made of silicon or germanium. So, to make a transistor act like a switch, a control wire is connected to a gate electrode. By changing the electrical charge of the gate, the conductivity of the semiconducting material can be manipulated, allowing the current to flow or be stopped, providing the same functionality as relays and vacuum tubes.

Transistors have several advantages over vacuum tubes, which were used in early electronic equipment. They are much faster, smaller, more reliable, and consume less power. They also generate less heat and are less prone to failure, making them ideal for use in electronic circuits.

Transistors have been used in a wide range of electronic equipment, including radios, televisions, and computers. One of their first applications was in IBM 608, released in 1957, which paved the way to the personal computing revolution. They have also been used in integrated circuits, which are small electronic circuits that are etched onto a single piece of semiconductor material. Integrated circuits can contain millions of transistors and are used in a wide range of electronic devices, including smartphones, computers, and cars.

Transistors have been a key enabling technology for the development of modern electronics, and their invention is considered to be one of the most important breakthroughs in the history of computing.
