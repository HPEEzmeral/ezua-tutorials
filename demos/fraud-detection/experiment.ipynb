    "# Fraud Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "Fraudulent activity has permeated multiple sectors, from e-commerce and healthcare to banking and payment systems. This\n",
    "illicit industry amasses billions every year and is on an upward trajectory. The 2018 global economic crime survey by\n",
    "PwC verifies this assertion, revealing that 49 percent of the 7,200 enterprises surveyed had fallen prey to some form of\n",

    "Despite the perceived peril of fraud to businesses, the advent of sophisticated systems, such as rule engines or machine\n",
    "learning, equips us with the tools to detect and prevent such behaviors. In this notebook, we demonstrate how a machine\n",
    "learning system helps us achieve this.\n",
    "\n",
    "At its core, a rules engine is a sophisticated software system that enforces one or more business rules in a real-time\n",
    "production environment. More often than not, these rules are the crystallization of hard-earned insights gleaned from\n",
    "domain experts. For instance, we could establish rules limiting the number of transactions in a given time frame, and\n",
    "blocking transactions that originate from previously identified fraudulent IPs and/or domains. Such rules prove highly\n",
    "effective in detecting certain types of fraud, yet they are not without their limitations. Rules with predefined\n",
    "threshold values may give rise to false positives or false negatives. To illustrate, imagine a rule that rejects any\n",
    "transaction exceeding \\\\$10,000 for a particular user. A seasoned fraudster might exploit this by staying one step\n",
    "ahead, consciously making a transaction slightly below this threshold (for instance, \\\\$9,999), thereby evading\n",
    "detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where machine learning comes to the rescue: By reducing both the risk of fraud and potential financial losses to\n",
    "businesses, machine learning fortifies the efficacy of the detection system. Combining this technology with rules-based\n",
