    "\n",
    "**Documentation**:  In addition to the models themselves, a registry can store important information about each model, like the data it was trained on, its performance metrics, and who created it. This documentation helps everyone understand what the model does and how it was built.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Collaboration**:  A model registry acts as a central hub for data scientists and engineers working on the same project. They can all access and use the models stored there, making collaboration smoother.\n",

    "**Deployment**:  Once you've chosen the best model version, the registry can help you deploy it into production, meaning you can use it to make real-world predictions.\n",
