    "# **Exercise 4:** Building a Image Classification Model with Tensorflow and MLflow\n",
    "\n",
    "You presented your Superset Dashboard to your retail company executives. They like the numbers and are raving about the insights you have gathered and visually presented in such an clean, intuitive manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "You're about to conclude when suddenly, someone sidetracks the conversation. Since the introduction of self-serve checkouts to your retail stores, your customers have had to manually search up fresh produce items through a clunky UI. \"What a pain!\" every executive cries. They've all experienced this during their own shopping.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"What about all of those self-serve checkouts that have cameras above the scanners?\" someone asks. \"Could we use them to **automatically detect** what produce a customer has just placed on the scale and deliver a wonderful, futurisitc user experience?\". They turn to you. You've now been tasked with building that very feature into all the self-serve checkouts across your company's stores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Seeing as video cameras are just a stream of static pictures, you realize that the first thing you will need to do is create a model to **detect produce in images**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will do just that, through learning how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Load and preprocess your image datasets.\n",
    "- Prepare a model for training on your dataset.\n",
    "- Learn about parameters and neural network layers.\n",
    "- Train a model using Tensorflow.\n",
    "- Store the modela and its training metrics in MLflow.\n",
    "- Test the model and validate its accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this exercise, you will have trained your own **classification model** using Tensorflow and MLflow to detect and classify produce (*\"That's a carrot!\"*) in any given image!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's dive in!"

    "To create a MobileNetV2 model, we'll first declare the **image data generators** specifically written for MobileNetV2 for each of the training, testing and validation datasets. The `ImageDataGenerator` class efficiently prepares and delivers batches of images during training. It utilizes a custom preprocessing function (`tf.keras.applications.mobilenet_v2.preprocess_input`) that prepares each image to MobileNetV2's requirements, typically including scaling pixel values and subtracting specific means from each color channel. This streamlined approach ensures images are formatted correctly for optimal performance within the MobileNetV2 architecture."

    "A few things our data generators will perform on our dataset include:\n",
    "- Utilizes tf.keras.preprocessing.image.ImageDataGenerator for real-time data augmentation during training.\n",
    "- The training images are loaded from a Pandas DataFrame using the specified 'Filepath' column for input data and 'Label' column for output data.\n",
    "- Images are resized to (224, 224) pixels, and the MobileNetV2 preprocessing function is applied.\n",
    "- Data augmentation techniques like rotation, zoom, shift, shear, and horizontal flip are employed to enhance the diversity of the training dataset.\n",
    "- Batches of 32 images are generated, and the order is shuffled for each epoch.\n",
    "\n",
    "They will be defined by the following parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **flow_from_dataframe:** This is a method provided by the `ImageDataGenerator` class in TensorFlow Keras. It specifically creates a data generator that reads data from a Pandas DataFrame. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **dataframe (train_df):** This refers to the Pandas DataFrame you provide. It's expected to contain two columns:\n",
    "   - **x_col ('Filepath')**: This column should contain the file paths of the images you want to train on.\n",
    "   - **y_col ('Label')**: This column should hold the corresponding labels for each image, likely representing the category it belongs to (e.g., \"cat\", \"dog\", \"car\").\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **target_size=(224, 224):** This specifies the desired size for the resized images. In this case, all images will be resized to 224 pixels wide and 224 pixels tall. Resizing images ensures consistency and reduces computational complexity during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **color_mode='rgb':** This indicates that the images are assumed to be in RGB color mode, which uses three channels (red, green, blue) to represent color information.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **class_mode='categorical':** This signifies that the task is categorical classification. The model will learn to classify images into predefined categories based on the labels provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **batch_size=32:** This defines the number of images that will be processed together as a single batch during training.  A batch size of 32 means the model will receive 32 images and their labels at a time to update its internal parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **shuffle=True:** This setting enables shuffling of the image order within each batch. Shuffling helps prevent the model from overfitting to the training data by ensuring it sees images in a random order during each training epoch (iteration).\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **seed=0:**  This sets a seed value for the random number generator used for shuffling and data augmentation.  Using a fixed seed ensures that the data order and augmentations are reproducible, meaning you'll get the same results when re-running the code. \n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Data Augmentation:** These are the following techniques applied to randomly modify the training images:\n",
    "    - **rotation_range=30:** Images are randomly rotated up to 30 degrees in either direction.\n",
    "    - **zoom_range=0.15:** Images are randomly zoomed in or out by up to 15%.\n",
    "    - **width_shift_range=0.2, height_shift_range=0.2:** Images are randomly shifted horizontally or vertically by up to 20% of their width or height, respectively.\n",
    "    - **shear_range=0.15:** A shearing transformation is applied to distort the image slightly.\n",
    "    - **horizontal_flip=True:** Images are randomly flipped horizontally (mirrored).\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **fill_mode=\"nearest\":** This setting determines how empty spaces created by image transformations (e.g., zooming) are filled. Here, the \"nearest\" neighbor pixel filling is used, meaning the value of the closest pixel is copied to fill the empty space.\n"

    "The ways in which machines learn concepts from new information is not dissimilar to the way humans do. Like humans, the method by which a machine learns is to be repeatedly exposed to data that reinforces that concept. Additionally, for any given person and any given concept, there is a better or best method to learn that concept (and of course, there are certainly suboptimal ways to learn that concept also!). In machine learning, these methods are defined by a set of **parameters** that will define how and when a model will be exposed to new data, such that it can best extrapolate patterns from it. \n",

    "\n",
    "#### **Epochs:** \n",
    "\n",
    "A single epoch is going through all 10 chapters **once**. Each time you re-read the textbook, you change your understanding of the content changes - some concepts are strengthened, some negated, others changed entirely. The number of **epochs** is the total amount of times you read the whole textbook through all 15 chapters. Read the textbook too few times and you will not be able to identify answers in the final quiz (known as **underfitting**). Read the book too many times, however, and you may memorize the content so well that any question that you will struggle with any question that does not strictly adhere to what you read in the book (known as **overfitting**). \n",

To properly engage with the content, you read a chapter or even sections of chapters at a time in **batches**. Too few chapters at a time will be slow, and you'll likely forget how concepts in chapters correlated to one another, affecting your learning. Read too fast and you'll miss key historic details.\n",

If by the fourth time you've read through the textbook, your are unable to answer the new questions correctly (that is to say, you cannot **abstract** your understanding to questions or content beyond what was in the textbook), you will stop studying and go talk with your professor - clearly there is something you're not getting, and there might be a better way to learn it. Do this too early and your professor will tell you that you didn't spend enough time learning the content to properly grasp it. Do this too late and you waste valuable study time trying to grasp a concept with an incorrect methodolgy. \n",

If after 4 epochs, the objects the models detect in the random test images are not what is labelled, then the training run will halt. In these instances, usually the dataset or the model parameters will need to be tweaked.  \n",

Using the **validation** dataset, we will validate the model's detection accuracy every runthrough of the dataset - and halt the training run if the accuracy is not adequate after **4** consecutive runs.\n",

    "MLflow is an open-source machine learning platform that is designed to help data scientists and engineers simplify the intricacies inherent in machine learning endeavors, rendering their projects more manageable, collaborative traceable, and reproducible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before the world was introduced to MLflow, engineers managed machine learning tasks using a mix of tools and methods, which lacked consistency and efficiency. They manually explored data, developed models with libraries like scikit-learn or TensorFlow, and tracked experiments in spreadsheets. Model management relied on conventional version control like Git, while deployment and monitoring required custom scripts. Collaboration and reproducibility suffered due to ad-hoc sharing (such as sharing large model files over networks) and difficulties in replicating experiments across environments (often due to confliciting libraries or dependencies).\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, MLflow is the most utilized and contributed machine learning platform and comes natively installed with **HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the course of the remainder of this exercise and the next, we will learn to leverage the key features of MLflow to build our produce recognition model, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Experiment Tracking**: MLflow enables users to meticulously track experiment details such as parameters and metrics. This functionality facilitates the comparison of different runs and aids in analyzing results, empowering data scientists to discern which models yield superior performance and allowing for fine-tuning of their approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model Management**: The platform provides tools for packaging and storing trained models in a reusable format. This ensures that models can be effortlessly applied to new data or shared with collaborators.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model Registry**: MLflow offers a Model Registry, allowing for centralized management of models and their various versions. This feature proves invaluable in production environments where model governance and monitoring are paramount.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Project Management**: MLflow facilitates the packaging of entire machine learning projects, encompassing code and environment settings, thereby streamlining sharing and reproducibility."
