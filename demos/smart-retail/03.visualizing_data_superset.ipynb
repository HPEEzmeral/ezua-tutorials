    "In the previous two exercises, we generated a large amount of synthetic sales data and created a smaller dataset using the Query Editor and EzPresto. In this exercise, we will visualize insights within this smaller dataset with **Apache Superset**. Superset allows users to create interactive dashboards and visualizations from various data sources, making it a valuable tool for data analysis and exploration.\n",

    "- Explore how to create a dataset from a cached data asset, ensuring efficient data retrieval and processing.\n",
    "- Learn to generate several types of charts, including bar charts, line charts, and scatter plots, to visualize different aspects of your data.\n",
    "- Combine these individual charts into a comprehensive dashboard, providing a holistic view of your data and facilitating insights and decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this exercise, you will have the skills to leverage Superset effectively for data visualization, enabling you to communicate complex insights and trends with clarity and impact.\n",
