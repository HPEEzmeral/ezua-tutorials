    "### Introduction to Apache Spark on HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics\n",
    "\n",
    "Apache Spark is a popular open-source big data framework that **distributes the computations** required to perform queries on large sets of data. This distribution, along with working with data in-memory rather than directly from storage disks, drastically brings down the time usually taken to query and index data. The combination of speed, versatility, and ease of use made Spark the go-to framework when working with big data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Apache Spark comes pre-installed with **HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics** and can leverage as much or as little of the compute available in a Unified Analytics cluster as a user desired. The core components of an Apache Spark deployment include:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./images/exercise1/spark_archi.PNG\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 60%;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Driver:** The driver program coordinates the execution of Spark jobs. It submits tasks to executors, schedules operations, and manages communication between various components.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Workers:** These are machines in the Spark cluster that manage executors. Each worker runs one or more executors. When running Spark on a HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics deployment, Spark Workers are Kubernetes pods distributed among worker nodes of the Unified Analytics cluster, allowing them to scale across multiple machines as required. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Executors:** Executors reside on worker nodes and carry out the actual computations assigned by the driver program. They partition and distribute the workload across machines in the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "**JVM:**  Spark utilizes the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) on each worker node to execute executors.\n",
    "\n",
    "On **HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics**, you will use Apache Spark to analyze large datasets at high speed with a unified platform for batch processing, streaming, and machine learning."
