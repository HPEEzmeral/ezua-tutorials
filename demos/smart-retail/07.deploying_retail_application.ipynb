    "## **2. Smart Retail Experience**\n",
    "\n",
    "You are now ready to run the Smart Retail Experience application - leveraging \n",
    "\n",
    "To learn more about building Docker and Helm applications and creating your own Smart Retail Experience from scratch, keep an eye out on the **HPE Ezmeral GitHub repository** for the latest tutorials, demos and feature showcases!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Remember EzPresto?\n",
    "\n",
    "It now seems like so long ago, but recall the delta tables you turned into a Data Source in Unified Analytics using Apache Hive in [Exercises 1](./01.exploring_data_with_spark.ipynb) and [2](./02.query_with_ezpreso.ipynb). Instead of having to manually load prices into our self-serve checkout application, which will differ from store to store, would it not be best to **pull from a centeralized table to always have the latest prices**? \n",
    "\n",
    "Like in [Exercise 3](./03.visualizing_data_superset), where we pulled data into Apache Superset, we can once again leverage **EzPresto** to query our datasets that we create from our connected Data Sources - no matter where that data came from or happens to reside! \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Smart Retail Experience application uses EzPresto to query the delta tables we connected through Hive. If you recall, we had **three** sales data tables - one each for our German, Swiss and Czech stores. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given the variance in pricing and currency, in order to test our Smart Retail Experience, you can **select which country you wish to get sales data for** from inside the Smart Retail Experience Application. \n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever an item is scanned, both the image frame and the selected `country` are parsed to the backend of the application. The frame will be sent to the model endpoint, where a prediction of what item is in the image will be returned. If a confidence threshold is met, that prediction (e.g. *orange*) is parsed as the `product` variable along with the `country` variable into an SQL query. This query is then made using EzPresto to our Cached Asset tables to get the last price of that item from that given country. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "table_name = f'retail.default.{country}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "PRICE = f\"SELECT unitprice FROM {table_name} WHERE PRODUCT = '{product}' LIMIT 1\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The prediction and retrieved price are then parsed back to the application, where the item is added to the cart!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Given that no single in-store self-serve checkout will be needing to start a cart in two countries, when the country is changed in the application **the shopping cart will reset**. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using the application\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you get started, grab some items to scan! The only items that will be detected by the application are those that were trained on in [Exercise 4](./04.model_training.ipynb). \n",
    "\n",
    "For the `Quick` dataset, detected items will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Apples\n",
    "- Bananas\n",
    "- Carrots\n",
    "- Cucumbers\n",
    "- Lemons\n",
    "- Oranges\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Click `Open` on your application. This will open the application in a new browser tab.\n",
    "2. A browser pop-up should appear to allow for your access to your webcam.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a moment to play with the application. Most of the below steps you will explore on your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Place or hold an item from the list above in front of your webcam.\n",
    "4. Click `Scan Item`. The image will now be processed.\n",
    "5. The detected item will retrieve its price from the Presto database of the currently selected country. \n",
    "6. Switch the Scanning Mode to `Auto`.\n",
    "7. When prompted by the status indicator, hold an item from the list above in front of your webcam.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detection Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "The detection threshold for any object is set to **80%**. That is, unless the model's predicted value for any given object is at least 80%, it will not add it to your cart.\n",
    "\n",
    "With respect to the model's performance, please keep in mind that your model is **very lightweight** and was trained on a **small set of data**. It may make the occasional error. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Scanning\n",
    "\n",
    "For demonstration purposes, there are two scanning modes in this applicaton: **Manual** and **Auto**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Manual**: Click the \"Scan Item\" button with an item present in the image. The frame will be captured on button press and sent to the model for detection. Whilst you *can* scan another item whilst the status indicator reads *Processing...*, it is best to wait until the status indicator reads *Ready to scan item.* before scanning your next item. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Auto**: In Auto mode, the status indicator will indicate when to place your item. The status will change to *Scanning...* when there is two seconds left before capture. This image will then be processed. The timing indicator bar is used to visually indicate the cycle between the Scanning and Processing states - each 7 seconds. This is more analogous to a self-serve checkout solution, where a customer will continually scan items and as one item is being processed, they are getting the next item from their basket or trolley."
