Installing on User-Provided Hosts (Connected and Air-gapped Environments) Provides the steps for installing HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software on user-provided hosts in connected and\n    air-gapped environments. A user-provided host is a bare metal machine or virtual machine (VM) that meets the\n    installation prerequisites. HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software supports bare metal and VM installations on AWS, GCP, and Azure. You can install HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software from a laptop or host\n      machine. Complete the following steps to install HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software on a bare metal machine or virtual machine (VM): Review the prerequisites and verify\n            that the requirements have been met. Run the installation script to\n            access the Installer Web UI. In the Installer Web UI, provide the pertinent information on each of the following\n            screens: Node Setup Installation\n              Details User Authentication\n                Details Complete the post-installation\n            steps. Prerequisites Verify that you have configured a pool of user-provided hosts that meet\n            the installation prerequisites. See Installation Prerequisites . You must have the HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software downloaded before you follow the instructions in this document.\n            The download includes the software binaries, installation script, Airgap Utility (for\n            air-gapped environments), and a README.txt file. After purchasing HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software , the downloads\n            are made available to you through the Access your products button in the HPE\n              Subscription Electronic Receipt email that you receive from HPE. The HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software deployment runs on a Kubernetes cluster. Components within HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software cannot launch\n            until they download their respective container images. How the components download the\n            container images depends on your environment. The following table describes container\n              downloads in different environments: Environment Description Direct connection If the machine is directly connected to the internet (UI accessible),\n                        you do not have to provide any proxy settings during installation. However,\n                        the firewall settings can prevent the packages from being\n                        downloaded. Proxy connection If the machine is connected to the internet via proxy, you must provide\n                        the proxy server information for http, https, and no_proxy during\n                        installation Air-gapped environment The Airgap Utility prerequisite describes the requirements for an\n                        air-gapped environment. See Installation Prerequisites . Run the Installation Script to Access the Installer Web UI To run the installation script and open the Installer Web UI, complete the following\n          steps: Go to the directory where you extracted the installer bundle ( HPE_Ezmeral_Unified_Analytics_Installer_S1U85-70016.star ): cd S1U85-70016 Run the installation script\n            on a host, but do\n            not run it on the hosts used to deploy HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software . See Installation Prerequisites for\n            details. ./start_ezua_installer_ui.sh The\n            launcher guides you through the prompts to start the Installer Web UI. NOTE If you get a permission denied error, run chmod +x\n                    start_ezua*.sh before you run the installation script. If the image is locally available, the container starts right away. If the image\n                  is not local, it takes time to download the image. Time for the image to download\n                  and start the container UI depends on network speed. If you ran the script on a laptop, you can access the installer UI by connecting\n                  to the browser using localhost:8080 . If you ran the script on a\n                  different node, you can access the installer UI by connecting to the browser using <node-ip-address>:8080 . Verify that port 8080 is opened\n                  through firewalls from the laptop to the node running the installer. If proxy settings are present in the environment, include the master node DNS\n                  names of the workload and coordinator clusters in the NO_PROXY list. On the screen that appears, select one of the following options: TIP The Ezmeral Coordinator is the\n              component that orchestrates the deployment of HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software instances. Installation Using New Ezmeral Coordinator For first time installation, select this option. When you install with a new Ezmeral Coordinator , you designate the control plane ( Ezmeral Coordinator and management\n                      cluster nodes) and worker nodes, as described in the following section, Node Setup . Installation Using Existing Ezmeral Coordinator If you previously installed HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software , select this option to use the existing Ezmeral Coordinator to\n                      create a new HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software cluster. All files in the existing cluster are cleared, except for the kubeconfig file for the Ezmeral Coordinator . You do not\n                      have to reconfigure the management cluster or upload the configuration file\n                      again. On the Select your deploy target screen, select Install in the Bare\n              Metal or VM tile. The Node Setup screen appears. Node Setup Node setup sets up the control plane and worker nodes. You can upload a YAML file or\n        manually configure the nodes through fields in the Installer Web UI. You\n          have the option of running an installation pre-check script, as described in step 2 of\n          this section. The following table describes control plane and worker nodes: Node Type Description Minimum Required Minimum Required for High Availability Control Plane Enter a comma-separated list of nodes (IP addresses). If you\n                  chose to install using a new Ezmeral Coordinator , the first node listed becomes the Ezmeral Coordinator node. This node\n                  orchestrates the deployment of HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software instances. The remainder of the nodes in the list\n                  serve as the management cluster. Installation Using New Ezmeral Coordinator (First-time installation) 2 * 4 ** Installation Using Existing Ezmeral Coordinator 1 3 Worker Enter a comma-separated list of nodes (IP addresses). These nodes run the HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software service. Calculate the number of worker nodes based on the VCPUs you enter in step\n                  7. Must be a minimum of 96 VCPUs. The accumulated total VCPU of the worker nodes\n                  should match or exceed the number of VCPUs that you enter in step 7. 3 N/A * Requires one node for the Ezmeral Coordinator and one node for the workload. ** Requires one node for the Ezmeral Coordinator and three nodes for the workload. IMPORTANT Either the SSH password or SSH key is required. The SSH pass phrase is optional and\n            only applicable if the SSH key is provided. Wall clock time on the hosts in the deployment must be synchronized. On the Node Setup screen, complete the following steps: Upload a YAML or complete the fields to manually configure the nodes. If you upload a YAML File, the system runs a validation check against\n              the file and returns an error message if the file is invalid. TIP A YAML\n                template file is provided and includes the following fields: controlplanes: \"\" # comma-separated list of ip values\nworkers: \"\" # comma-separated list of ip values\nssh_username: root\nssh_password: \"\"\nssh_key: \"\" # base64 encoded string\nssh_passphrase: \"\" (Optional) Run the installation pre-check script. The installation pre-check script\n              runs checks against each of the host machines configured for HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software , including the Ezmeral Coordinator , control\n              plane, and worker hosts. The script also does an aggregated check to verify that the\n              hosts, operating as a cluster, have enough resources to support the installation. Running the pre-check script can take some time; however, you can continue the\n              installation as the pre-check runs in the background. When the pre-check completes,\n              the system posts a message stating that the pre-check succeeded or failed. In case of\n              failure, return to the Node Setup screen. The system posts the node(s) that did\n              not pass pre-check. In case of failure, complete the following steps to access the\n              logs in the UI container: To exec into the Docker container,\n                  run: docker exec -it node-server bash Go to the prechecks directory: cd /tmp/prechecks To view the prechecks logs: cat prechecksLogs.txt Check the logs for errors and resolve the errors. Once resolved, run the\n                  installation pre-check again to verify that the issue is resolved and then\n                  complete installation. Click Next to proceed to Installation Details . Installation Details On the Installation Details screen, complete the following steps: Complete the following fields: Field Description Installation Name Enter a unique name for the installation. The installation name must\n                    consist of lowercase alphanumeric characters or - . For example, installation-1 . This name becomes the name of the cluster\n                    namespace. In the future, if you need to add additional hosts to increase\n                    resources for applications, you will use this name as the namespace when adding\n                    hosts, as described in Expanding the Cluster . Domain Name Enter a valid DNS domain name to connect to the cluster via the browser. NOTE The HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software cluster domain name cannot be the same as the DNS\n                          host domain name. Do not enter your corporate top level domain (TLD) name in this field.\n                          If you enter the corporate TLD name, you must set up a wildcard record\n                          that points all subdomains of the corporate domain to the HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software ingress gateway hosts. Best practice is to enter a subdomain off the corporate domain. For\n                          example, if your corporate domain is company.com , you\n                          could enter ezua.company.com as your domain name. As you continue the installation process, you will set up wildcard\n                          records for the domain name you enter in this field. The DNS name\n                          resolution to those records should work for pods and any member of your\n                          organization that needs access to HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software . VCPU The number of VCPUs that you enter is determined by the number of worker\n                    nodes. Typically, 96 VCPUs translates to three worker nodes, and entering 97\n                    would translate to four worker nodes. If you need to distinguish between cores\n                    and VCPUs, for example in cases where hyperthreading is enabled, run the lscpu tool to accurately determine the VCPUs for your\n                    hosts. High Availability When selected, three controller nodes are enabled. Currently, HA is\n                    available for the workload cluster only. The management cluster does not support\n                    HA. Use GPU See GPU Support . Air Gap Environment Select this option when installing in an air-gapped environment (no\n                    internet access). If you select Air Gap Environment, you must provide the\n                    registry details. Registry URL Enter the registry URL. Only required for air-gapped environments, but can\n                    also be used for a custom image registry in connected environments. Make sure\n                    you add the trailing / at the end of the URL, as shown in the\n                    following example: my-registry.mip.storage.mycompany.net/ezua/ Username Enter the user name for the administrative user. Password Enter the password for the administrative user. Registry Insecure Select this option if the registry is not secure. If the registry is\n                    secure, do not select this option. CA Certificate Upload the CA certificate. See Working with Certs and the Truststore . TLS Certificates Use Self Signed Certificate - Typically only selected for POCs and\n                        demos. For production environments, HPE recommends uploading your own\n                        certificates (CA certificate and Private Key). CA Certificate - Upload the CA certificate Private Key - Upload the private key. Certificate - Upload additional certificates. See AD/LDAP Servers and Working with Certs and the Truststore . Proxy Details NOTE The proxy details apply to the HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software application; they do not apply to the\n                      host. HTTP Proxy - Enter the URL for the proxy data center. HTTPS Proxy - Enter the URL for the proxy data center. No Proxy - Each of the hosts in the HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software cluster must have the IP addresses of the coordinator and control\n                          plane hosts of the workload cluster in the no_proxy list. Add\n                        the FQDN of the master host in the workload cluster OR a comma-separated list of IP addresses or hostnames . Note that\n                        some of the IP addresses in the cluster are required to bypass the proxy\n                        settings to reach the internal pod/container entities. Use the following\n                        string of IP addresses to bypass the proxy settings: 10.96.0.0/12,10.224.0.0/16,10.43.0.0/16,\\\n.external.hpe.local,localhost,.cluster.local,.svc,\\\n.default.svc,127.0.0.1 For example, if your domain is ezua.company.com , you would enter the following string\n                        for no_proxy: 10.96.0.0/12,10.224.0.0/16,10.43.0.0/16,\n.external.hpe.local,localhost,.cluster.local,.svc,\\\n.default.svc,127.0.0.1, ezua.company.com External URL - This field only applies to the workload nodes and is\n                        only required if you select HA for the HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software application. If you want HA for\n                        the Ezmeral Coordinator ,\n                        contact HPE Support before you install on the Ezmeral Coordinator node. Click Next to proceed to User Authentication Details . User Authentication Details Connected and air-gapped installations can use internal or external LDAP. Internal LDAP is\n        typically used for POC and demo scenarios. External LDAP is typically used for production\n        environments. See AD/LDAP Servers . To add user authentication details, complete the following steps: Either select or do not select the option to use an external LDAP server.

IMPORTANT The HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software product downloaded includes the software binaries, installation script, Air Gap Utility\n          (for air-gapped environments), and a README.txt file. After purchasing HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software , the downloads are\n          made available to you through the Access your products button in the HPE\n            Subscription Electronic Receipt email that you receive from HPE. When creating a domain name, opt for a subdomain name that is only used for HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software . For example, if\n          your top level domain (TLD) name is company.com , use a subdomain name\n          such as ezua.company.com . Software Binaries The README.txt file included with the product provides instructions for downloading and\n        extracting the HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software binaries that are required to install the product, including the Air Gap Utility. Air Gap Utility (Only required for air-gapped environments) Use the Air Gap Utility to get the required container images. Create a local repository if\n        you do not already have one. In addition to setting up a local repository, you must also set\n        up a RHEL/Rocky 8-based yum repository. The installer runs yum commands\n        against this repository. See Using the Air Gap Utility for additional information. For\n        operating system support, see the Operating System support matrix. Host Machines HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software installation\n        requires two types of host machines with the following minimum storage requirements: Table 1 . Host Machine Requirements Machine Type VCPU Memory Size (GB) Disk Size (Disk Count) Machine Count Control plane ( Ezmeral Coordinator /Management Cluster) 4 32 500 (1) 2 Workload 32 128 500 (2) 3 Launcher Host 1 2 4 1 This is the host that\n        runs the installation script. This host is separate from the hosts that deploy HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software . This host must also\n        have Docker version 20.10 (with a minimum of 20GB storage) and firewall allowed on port\n          8080. IMPORTANT To meet VCPU sizing requirements, at least three storage capable hosts are\n              required. Host machines must have a sudo password. Mount Points The supported mount points and their minimum sizes depends on the type of host. The\n              host file system must have at least the root mount point: / The\n                total minimum required size is the combination of all the mount point sizes listed\n                in the table for a given type of host. If you choose not to configure a listed mount\n                point, that mount point's required size must be added to the root\n                  ( / ) mount point. For example, if you choose not to\n                configure /opt as a separate mount point on the Controller host,\n                you must add the 100GB listed for /opt to the 50GB listed for the\n                root mount point (/). That is, if /opt is not a separate mount\n                point, the Controller host requires 150GB for the root ( / ) mount\n                point. The storage size for the Controller and Shadow Controller hosts must\n                  match. Table 2 . Mount Point Requirements for Controller and Shadow Controller\n                    Hosts Mount Point Minimum Size (GB) Purpose / 50 Root file system where the Unified Analytics components are\n                          stored /var , or /var/lib , or /var/lib/docker 150 Stores container metadata information /opt 100 Stores all Unified Analytics software /srv or /srv/bluedata 20 /srv/bluedata stores all temporary runtime files,\n                          including any artifacts, such as scripts and JAR files, that have been\n                          uploaded for running jobs. Table 3 . Mount Point Requirements for Kubernetes Hosts Mount Point Minimum Size (GB) Purpose / 70 Root file system where the Unified Analytics components are stored. /var , or /var/lib , or /var/lib/containerd , or /var/lib/docker 150 Stores container metadata information. /var/lib/containerd is used for hosts running the\n                          Hewlett Packard Enterprise distribution of Kubernetes. /var/lib/docker is used for the other hosts in the\n                          deployment. /opt 50 Stores all Unified Analytics software. /opt/ezkube (on\n                          Kubernetes hosts hosts only), /opt/bluedata , and /opt/hpe are used to install Unified Analytics . VCPU Sizing Guidelines The combined VCPUs of worker hosts should be no less than 96 for deploying HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software services and apps; otherwise, some services cannot start due to lack of resources.\n                  If the machine configuration has 16 VCPU and 64 GB of memory, HPE recommends using\n                  a minimum of six (6) machines. When installing HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software , the VCPU option (on the Installation Details screen) should\n                  be equal to or less than the total VCPUs of the combined capability of the worker\n                  hosts; otherwise, the installation will fail due to lack of resources. DNS Configuration The DNS configuration requires that: All hosts have A records added to DNS. The name resolution works forward and backward. The FQDN is a maximum of 63 characters. All hosts must be part of the DNS domain and be able to resolve the FQDNs. Operating System HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software supports RHEL\n        8.8. All machines serving as hosts must run the same OS. Both GPU\n        and non-GPU hosts are supported with RHEL 8.8. Hewlett Packard Enterprise strongly recommends using only dedicated hosts with clean OS\n        installations on them. Installing HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software on hosts with other running applications can cause unpredictable\n        behavior. To ensure your OS has the latest packages, Hewlett Packard Enterprise recommends\n        performing a yum update before installation. Use the standard OS kernel; modifications may cause HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software to function unpredictably. To minimize the need for troubleshooting, Hewlett Packard Enterprise recommends newer kernel versions. HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software does not\n        support upgrades between major OS versions. For example, if you are migrating from OS\n        version 7.x to 8.x, you must perform a new installation (not an upgrade), and then install HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software . RHEL 8.8 Requirements HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software has\n              the following RHEL requirements: RHEL systems must have active, valid subscriptions in order to access the RHEL\n                  RPM repositories. Firewall is supported only in iptables mode for RHEL 8.8. TIP The GPU operator does not support Ubuntu or Rocky. Rocky works in non-GPU environments. For information related to operating systems and operating system version\n                    support, contact HPE Support. Network HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software installation\n        have the following network requirements: Table 4 . Network Requirements VM DNS Network IP Address Single vNIC, static IP DNS server to resolve the FQDN Single network connecting all machines. Static: 2 controller machine + 3 worker machines Disable IP Checksum Before you install HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software , run the following script on all nodes to disable IP checksum: #! /bin/bash\n\n# Script to disable ip checksum offload using ethtool for the primary nic.

Installing HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software on OpenShift Provides the prerequisites and steps for installing HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software in an OpenShift cluster\n    and also lists the current limitations. To install HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software in an OpenShift cluster, complete the following steps: 1. Complete the Prerequisites. A. Verify that the VMs (nodes) in the OpenShift cluster meet the installation requirements B. Apply labels to the storage nodes C. (Air-Gapped Only) Inject HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software images into your local repository D. (Air-Gapped Only) Apply the image registry certificate E. Install the CertManager 2. Install HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software . Currently, you can install HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software through the Installer Web UI only. See Install HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software with the Installer Web UI . The ability to install HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software manually (through a CLI) is coming soon. NOTICE Temporary Limitations Upcoming releases will address the following temporary limitations: Some Pods in the HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software platform must run as root . To avoid\n                    permission-denied errors, the HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software installation process sets the anyuidsecurity context in some namespaces to allow root-based\n                    execution. Some Pods in the HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software platform require HostPath-based volume mounts, which\n                    OpenShift denies by default. These Pods need permission to mount HostPath\n                    volumes. Permission to mount these volumes is granted by the securityContext parameter, with privileged set to true . Read more about OpenShift security context constraints here . A. Verify that the VMs (nodes) in the OpenShift cluster meet the installation\n        requirements The following table lists the requirements: Prerequisite Details Operating System RHEL8.8 based RHCOS OpenShift An OpenShift 4.12.x cluster must be dedicated to HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software . Storage Minimum of 3 storage nodes, each with at least: 16 vCPUs 32 GB RAM 2 additional disks with a minimum of 500 GB GPU The only GPU model supported is Nvidia A100 GPU with Multi-Instance (MIG)\n                      configuration. The MIG configuration must be applyed equally to all GPU cards. Install the NFD and GPU operators and then create instances of these through\n                      the OpenShift console. When done, verify that the GPU is active. B. Apply labels to the storage nodes Tag your storage nodes (non-GPU worker nodes) with the \"hpe.com/dataplatform\"=\"true\" label, as shown in the following example that uses\n        generic DNS names: kubectl label no worker0.user01.ezfab.local \"hpe.com/dataplatform\"=\"true\" \nkubectl label no worker1.user01.ezfab.local \"hpe.com/dataplatform\"=\"true\" \nkubectl label no worker2.user01.ezfab.local \"hpe.com/dataplatform\"=\"true\" \nkubectl label no worker3.user01.ezfab.local \"hpe.com/dataplatform\"=\"true\" NOTE You\n          need at least three storage nodes in your cluster that meet this requirement. This\n          is not required for all nodes. Refer to the section A (above) for details about the\n          required configuration for each storage node. C. (Air-Gapped Only) Inject HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software images into your local repository For an air-gapped installation, you must inject the HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software images into a local\n        repository that you will use to bootstrap the installation process. For this purpose: HPE recommends having an empty dedicated image registry. You can also use an existing\n            image registry with other pre-existing images. Run the HPE Ezmeral Airgap Utility from a\n            connected host. The Airgap Utility connects to the HPE Greenlake image repository\n            marketplace to download the images into your local registry. To inject images into\n              your local repository, create a local registry (optional) and download the\n                images (required) : (Optional) Create a local registry. You\n              have many options to create a local registry. If you already have a registry or want\n              to follow your own procedure to set one up, skip to step 2 (Download Images). The registry can be hosted on a container, virtual machine, or BareMetal. This\n              document describes how to set up a registry inside a container using the podmanutility . The container OS is RHEL8. To create a local\n              registry, complete the following steps: On a fresh RHEL BareMetal/VM, deploy all the utilities required to create the\n                  container: yum module enable -y container-tools:rhel8\n\nyum module install -y container-tools:rhel8 Install the additional dependencies required for the\n                  process: yum install -y httpd-tools jq wget Create the following directories: certs/: stores certificates to enable https access to the registry auth/: authentication files for the registry data/: location where the registry stores all the images To create the\n                        directories,\n                        run: mkdir -p /local_registry/{certs, auth, data} Later,\n                        you will mount these directories to the registry container. (Optional) Create self-signed certificates. Complete this step to make your\n                  registry accessible through HTTPS. You can also use a company-wide certificate. In\n                  that case, simply copy your certificate to the local_registry/certsdirectory and skip to the next step. NOTE You can use the same certificate across more than one registry. There are many ways to use openssl to create a\n                    self-signed certificate, for example: openssl req -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -sha256 -keyout <$KEY_FILE_LOCATION> -x509 -days 365 -subj \"/CN= <$CERTIFICATE_NAME> \" -addext \"subjectAltName = DNS: <$FULL_DNS> \" -out <$CRT_FILE_LOCATION> //Example:\nopenssl req -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -sha256 -keyout /local_registry/certs/domain.key -x509 -days 365 -subj \"/CN=Myname\" -addext \"subjectAltName = DNS:*.example.com\" -out /local_registry/certs/domain.crt You must copy this certificate file to the standard location of the\n                    operating system. For RHEL, the standard cert location is /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors : cp /local_ registry/certs/domain.crt /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/ After you copy the file, run: update-ca-trust Create access credentials to the registry to keep it secure. You can skip this\n                  step for anonymous\n                  access. htpasswd -bBc /local_registry/auth/ <$PASSWORD_FILENAME> <$USERNAME> <$PASSWORD> //Example:\nhtpasswd -bBc /local_registry/auth/htpd user01 admin123 Expose the registry on port 5000. Add this rule to firewalld to\n                  open the port and make it\n                  available. firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-port=5000/tcp \nfirewall-cmd reload Create the container to use as local registry. In this example, podman is used to create the container; however, you can use\n                  any container utility that you prefer: podman run -d --name <$REGISTRY NAME> -p <$PORT>:<$PORT> \\ \n-v <$DATA_DIRECTORY> :/var/lib/registry:z \\ \n-v <$AUTH_DIRECTORY> :/auth:z \\ \n-v <$CERT_DIRECTORY> :/certs:z \\ \n-e \"REGISTRY_AUTH=htpasswd\" \\ \n-e \"REGISTRY_AUTH_HTPASSWD_REALM= <$REALM_NAME> \" \\ \n-e \"REGISTRY_HTTP_SECRET= <$PHRASE_FOR_SECRET> \" \\ \n-e \"REGISTRY_AUTH_HTPASSWD_PATH= <$PATH_TO_AUTH_FILE> \" \\ \n-e \"REGISTRY_HTTP_TLS_CERTIFICATE= <$PATH_TO_CERT_FILE> \" \\ \n-e \"REGISTRY_HTTP_TLS_KEY= <$PATH_TO_KEY_FILE> \" \\ <$REGISTRY_IMAGE> //Example:\npodman run -d --name local-registry -p 5000:5000 \\ \n-v /local_registry/data:/var/lib/registry:z \\ \n-v /local_registry/auth:/auth:z \\ \n-v /local_registry/certs:/certs:z \\ \n-e \"REGISTRY_AUTH=htpasswd\" \\ \n-e \"REGISTRY_AUTH_HTPASSWD_REALM=my-local-registry\" \\ \n-e \"REGISTRY_HTTP_SECRET=ALongRandomSecretForLocalRegistry\" \\ \n-e \"REGISTRY_AUTH_HTPASSWD_PATH=/auth/htpd\" \\ \n-e \"REGISTRY_HTTP_TLS_CERTIFICATE=/certs/domain.crt\" \\ \n-e \"REGISTRY_HTTP_TLS_KEY=/certs/domain.key\" \\ \ndocker.io/library/registry:2 Use curl to access the registry and test that the registry is\n                  up and running: curl  -u <$USERNAME>:<$PASSWORD> -k -X GET https://$(hostname -f):5000/v2/_catalog \n\n//Example:\ncurl -u user01:admin123 -k -X GET https://local-registry.example.com:5000/v2/_catalog (Required) Download the images. To download the images, refer\n              to Using the Air Gap Utility for information about pulling HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software images into\n              the local registry. D. (Air-Gapped Only) Apply the image registry certificate You can configure your air-gapped registry with HTTP or HTTPS (see previous steps).\n        To make it accessible using the HTTPS protocol, you need to add a certificate to the\n        registry. This certificate can be a self-signed certificate (see previous steps) or a\n        company-wide common certificate. The same certificate can be used for multiple registries.\n        If there are multiple registries and all of them are configured with different certificates,\n        the OpenShift configuration should be updated with all the certificates. Follow this\n        procedure to update the registry certificate on your OpenShift cluster. Create a config map with all the certificates for accessing multiple\n        registries. The following syntax shows how to create one config map with\n        one registry and one\n        certificate. kubectl create -n openshift-config cm <$REGISTRY_CONFIG_NAME> --from-file= <$REGISTRY_URL_WITHOUT_PROTOCOL> = <$CERTIFICATE_FILENAME> If\n        you have more than one registry and more than one certificate, run this instead: kubectl create -n openshift-config cm <$REGISTRY_CONFIG_NAME> \\ \n      --from-file= <$REGISTRY_URL_WITHOUT_PROTOCOL> = <$CERTIFICATE_FILENAME> \\ \n      --from-file= <$REGISTRY_URL_WITHOUT_PROTOCOL> = <$CERTIFICATE_FILENAME> //Example: \nkubectl create -n openshift-config cm image-registry-config --from-file=image-registry.example.com=registry.crt \nkubectl create -n openshift-config cm multiple-registry-config -\\\n      --from-file=image-registry.example.com=registry.crt \\ \n      --from-file=image-registry.example.com..5000=registry.crt \\ \n      --from-file=new-image-registry.example.com=newCert.crt Once the configmap is available, patch that configmap with the\n        existing OpenShift config: kubectl patch image.config.openshift.io cluster --type merge -p '{\"spec\":{\"additionalTrustedCA\":{\"name\":\" <$REGISTRY_CONFIG_NAME> \"}}}' \n\n//Example: \nkubectl patch image.config.openshift.io cluster --type merge -p '{\"spec\":{\"additionalTrustedCA\":{\"name\":\" multiple-registry-config \"}}}' E. Install the CertManager Install the cert manager on the OpenShift cluster. The version should be higher than 1.10. To install CertManager,\n        run: kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.13.1/cert-manager.yaml Install HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software with the Installer Web UI To install HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software on OpenShift through the Installer Web UI, complete the followign steps: Run the installation script that was provided with the software bundle. The host on\n            which you run this command must be connected to the internet (the Web UI image is public\n            for the specific version of HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software that you are installing) or must point to a local registry where\n            you pre-pulled the Web UI image. Running the installation script opens the launcher\n              that guides you through the prompts to start the Installer Web UI. For a connected environment,\n                run: ./start_ezua_installer_ui.sh For an air-gapped environment, run the following command and provide the\n                URL of the image repository that you configured as a\n                prerequisite: ./start_ezua_installer_ui.sh --image <$PRIVATE_REGISTRY> /us.gcr.io/mapr-252711/hpe-ezua-installer-ui Copy the OpenShift kubeconfig to the UI installer container. The\n              UI installer is a container that accesses the OpenShift cluster via kubectl commands. You must give the UI installer container kubectl access to the OpenShift cluster. In a connected environment, you can download the OpenShift kubeconfig from the OpenShift console. In an air-gapped environment, use the kubeconfig that was generated during\n              installation. Once you have the kubeconfig , run the following command to\n                  place it in the container running the HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software Web UI Installer (located at ~/.kube/config ): docker cp < $PATH_TO_KUBECONFIG> <$CONTAINER_ID> :/root/.kube/config Update the hosts entries in the Web UI Installer so it can reach the OpenShift\n                    cluster. In a connected environment , you can find the hosts entries of your\n                      OpenShift cluster in the OpenShift console. In the OpenShift console, go to Clusters on the left and then select the cluster on which you are\n                      installing HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software . Under the Installation Progress card, click Not Able to\n                        Access the Web Console? . In the dialog that opens, copy the list of\n                          hosts: Example: Screenshot from the\n                          OpenShift console that shows the hosts of an example OpenShift\n                          cluster. In an air-gapped environment , copy the DNS entries (used during\n                      installation) to the Web UI Installer: To exec into the Web UI Installer container,\n                          run: docker exec --it <$CONTAINER_ID> bash Edit the /etc/hosts file and add the host entries. Navigate back to the launcher that opened when you ran the installation script to\n            start the Installer Web UI. Select Install in the OpenShift tile. On the OpenShift Setup screen, upload your OpenShift kubeconfig and then\n            click Next . See Installing on User-Provided Hosts (Connected and Air-gapped Environments) to continue installation, starting with Installation Details on that\n              page. TIP If installation fails, you can access the Installer Web UI logs\n              in the live container at /root/ezua-installer-ui/log. On this page A.

HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software Service\n    Activation and Billing Processes Provides post-installation steps required to activate HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software in connected and\n    air-gapped environments. When you install HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software through the installation wizard, you have the option to install in a\n      connected environment or air-gapped environment. The activation and billing processes differ\n      for each type of installation. In a connected environment, billing is an automated process. In\n      an air-gapped environment, the billing process is manual and requires an activation code in\n      addition to an activation key. After you install and deploy HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software , the system provides you with a URL to access Unified Analytics . The first time you go to the URL,\n      the system prompts you for an activation key (and an activation code for air-gapped\n      environments) to activate the product. The following sections provide the information needed to get the activation key and\n      activation code (for air-gapped environments). When you have those, you can return to the Unified Analytics URL and enter the activation\n      key to activate Unified Analytics .

Service Activation and Billing in Connected Environments Provides information for administrators about HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software activation and billing in a connected environment,\n    including activation steps. An administrator needs the following information to activate Unified Analytics in a connected environment: Information Description Platform\n                  ID Unique, system-generated ID assigned to the Ezmeral Coordinator instance during installation. The ID is displayed when\n                    you go to the Unified Analytics URL provided after installation. Activation key The license file that the administrator uploads to complete the installation\n                  of Unified Analytics . The\n                  administrator can download the activation key in their MY\n                    HPE SOFTWARE CENTER customer portal. The activation key file is a signed\n                  XML file. Service activation and billing in connected environments is mostly automated. The only\n        manual process that the administrator performs is going to MY HPE SOFTWARE\n          CENTER and downloading the activation key file and then uploading the file into Unified Analytics to activate the product.\n        The activation key is valid for the length of the contract, typically one, three, or five\n        years unless the contract is made invalid, such as product cancellation or failure to meet\n        the contractual agreement. To activate Unified Analytics , an\n        administrator completes the following steps: Install and deploy Unified Analytics .\n            For connected environments, select the Connected option during installation. The system\n            provides the URL to access Unified Analytics . Go to the Unified Analytics UI URL\n            provided. The window displays a Platform ID and requests an activation key. You cannot\n            proceed with activation until you provide the activation key file. Copy the unique Platform ID. After purchasing HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software , the activation key is made available to you through the Activate your products button in the HPE Subscription Electronic Receipt email that you receive from HPE. This receipt directs you to MY HPE\n              SOFTWARE CENTER where you can activate your product. On the Activate EON page, enter the Platform ID (copied in step 3) in the Platform ID\n            field. Once activation is completed, download the Unified Analytics activation key file. Return to the Unified Analytics URL and\n            upload the activation key file. Billing Process in Connected Environments When the activation key is uploaded, the cluster registers with the HPE billing service.\n        Consumption data is uploaded to the HPE billing service on an hourly basis. Consumption data\n        is based on the vCPU used by applications every hour. Partners Support Dev-Hub Community Training ALA Privacy Policy Glossary Search Search current doc version",

An administrator needs the following information to activate Unified Analytics in an air-gapped environment: Information Description Platform\n                  ID Unique, system-generated ID assigned to the Ezmeral Coordinator instance during installation. The ID is displayed when\n                    you go to the Unified Analytics URL provided after installation. Activation key The license file that the administrator uploads to complete the installation\n                  of Unified Analytics . The\n                  administrator can download the activation key in their MY\n                    HPE SOFTWARE CENTER customer portal. The activation key file is a signed\n                  XML file. Activation code A unique code that HPE Ezmeral Customer Support gives to the administrator\n                  every 30 days to keep clusters in an active state. Automatically deactivated after\n                  45 days (includes a 15-day grace period). The activation code file is a signed\n                  JSON file. See Billing Process in Air-Gapped Environments and Renewing the Activation Code . Service activation and billing in an air-gapped environment requires an activation key file\n        and an activation code. The activation code must be renewed on a monthly basis (every 30\n        days). See Billing Process in\n          Air-Gapped Environments . Getting the Activation Key File and Activation Code To get the activation key: Install and deploy Unified Analytics .\n            For air-gapped deployments, select the Air-Gapped option during installation. The system\n            provides the URL to access Unified Analytics . Go to the Unified Analytics URL\n            provided. The window displays a Platform ID and requests an activation key and\n            activation code. You cannot proceed with the activation until you provide the activation\n            key file and activation code. Copy the unique Platform ID. After purchasing HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software , the activation key is made available to you through the Activate your products button in the HPE Subscription Electronic Receipt email that you receive from HPE. This receipt directs you to MY HPE\n              SOFTWARE CENTER where you can activate your product. On the Activate EON page, enter the Platform ID (copied in step 3) in the Platform ID\n            field. Once activation is completed, download the Unified Analytics activation key file. Return to the Unified Analytics URL and\n            upload the activation key file. To get the first activation code to activate Unified Analytics : To request the activation code, open a support case at https://support.hpe.com using the account you have on the HPE Support Center\n            customer portal. The support ticket must include the following information: Activation key Platform ID Cluster ID TIP This is the same portal that you would\n                  use to create any kind of ticket related to your platform. If you do not have an\n                  account, you can create an account for free. When you create an account, you must\n                  link your support contract to the account. If you have never used the customer\n                  portal, refer to the KB article here to help you get your support portal\n                  account up and running. When support notifies you that the activation code is available in your customer\n            portal, go to the portal and get the code. Return to the Unified Analytics URL and\n            upload both the activation key and activation code files. Billing Process in Air-Gapped Environments Contracts for air-gapped installations must be validated with an activation code on a\n        monthly basis. The Unified Analytics cluster\n        securely stores billing data. The Unified Analytics site administrator must download the billing data at the end of the\n        billing cycle and then open an HPE Support Center customer support ticket to renew the\n        activation code. The support ticket that the administrator opens must include the following\n          information: Billing data (downloaded from the Billing tab in Unified Analytics ) Cluster ID HPE Support Center renews the certificate and credentials through the billing and\n        registration system and then uploads the new activation code to your customer portal. This\n        cycle continues on a monthly basis to keep clusters active. Failure to adhere to this\n        process can result in cluster deactivation or service disruption. Unified Analytics provides regular updates and\n        reminder alerts on the product screen. Renewing the Activation Code To get a new activation code (every 30 days), complete the following steps: Sign in to Unified Analytics . In the left navigation bar, select Administration > Settings . Click the Billing tab. On the Billing tab, download the billing data for the current billing\n            cycle. Open a support case at https://support.hpe.com using the account you have on the HPE\n            Support Center customer portal and include the following information: Cluster ID Billing data file When support updates the ticket, go to your customer portal to get the new activation\n            code. Return to Unified Analytics , and enter\n            the activation code in the Activation Code field on the Billing tab. IMPORTANT Failure to complete these steps monthly can result in access to the Unified Analytics applications and\n              services being disabled.

Display images less than a certain\n                size: ezua-airgap-util --release <release-number> --lessthan 1mb Display images greater than a certain\n                size: ezua-airgap-util --release <release-number> --greaterthan 5gb Display images between two\n                sizes: ezua-airgap-util --release <release-number> --lessthan 6gb --greaterthan 5gb You can combine filters to provide a more customized query, for\n            example: ezua-airgap-util --release <release-number> --component falco To filter for a specific name or string, you can use the options \u2013noheaders | grep\n              <String> : ezua-airgap-util --release <release-number> --noheaders | grep <String> Downloading Air Gap Files After Using Air Gap Utility Filters to find the necessary files for\n        your deployment, download the files as follows: Use a single command to filter and copy air gap files to a local filesystem or remote\n            registry. Include all filters you want to apply to your download. Include --dest_compress to compress the files and download in a .tgz file.\n            Otherwise, the files download in a .tar file. For\n            example: ezua-airgap-util --release <release-number> --lessthan 1mb --copy --dest_path images/ --dest_compress Use --force to delete the .tgz or .tar file of the image if it already\n            exists. For\n              example: ezua-airgap-util --release <release-number> --lessthan 1mb --copy --dest_path images/ --force\nezua-airgap-util --release <release-number> --lessthan 1mb --copy --dest_path images/ --dest_compress --force To copy multiple images to a local filesystem, run the following command.\n                Provide the destination path where you want to store your\n                files. ezua-airgap-util --release <release-number> <add-on_filters> --copy --dest_path <destination-path> To copy a single image to a local filesystem, execute the following\n                command. Provide the destination path where you want to store your\n                files. ezua-airgap-util --release <release-number> --image <image-name> --copy --dest_path <destination-path> To copy multiple images to a remote container registry, select one of the\n                following options. Provide the destination URL and credentials for your container\n                  registry. Use the --dest_creds <username:password> command line\n                    option: ezua-airgap-util --release <release-number> <add-on-filters> --copy --dest_url <destination-url> --dest_creds <username:password> Alternatively, set environment variable AIRGAP_UTIL_CREDS .\n                    You can set environmental variables using the export command: export AIRGAP_UTIL_CREDS=<username>:<password> To copy a single image to a remote container registry, execute the\n                    following command. Provide the destination URL and credentials for your\n                    container\n                    registry. ezua-airgap-util --release <release-number> --image <image-name> --copy --dest_url <destination-url> --dest_creds <username:password> Air Gap Utility Logging By default, the Air Gap Utility creates a logs/ directory in the present\n        working directory from which you invoked the Air Gap Utility command line. You can change the log directory location as follows: If you pass the --logdir argument in the Air Gap Utility command\n            line, then the Air Gap Utility creates a logs/ directory in the path\n            provided in the --logdir arguement. If you set the AIRGAP_UTIL_LOGDIR environment variable, but do not\n            pass the --logdir argument in the Air Gap Utility command line, then\n            the Air Gap utility creates a logs/ directory in the path set in the AIRGAP_UTIL_LOGDIR environment variable. NOTE The Air Gap Utility does not create log files when commands are run in TTY mode. For\n              example: ezua-airgap-util --release v1.3.0 | grep -i airflow Using Skopeo --options with the Air Gap Utility This section describes how to use Skopeo --options with the Air Gap\n        Utility and provides usage examples. The following examples show the Skopeo --preserve-digests and --retry-times options used with the Air Gap\n        Utility: ezua-airgap-util --release v1.3.0 --image longhornio/livenessprobe:v2.9.0 --copy --dest_path ezua-v1.3.0/ --options=\"--preserve-digests\" zua-airgap-util --release v1.3.0 --image longhornio/livenessprobe:v2.9.0 --copy --dest_path ezua-v1.3.0/ --options=\"--retry-times 5\" You\n        can use multiple Skopeo options with the Air Gap Utility. The following example demonstrates how to use the Skopeo --preserve-digests and --retry-times options\n        together: ezua-airgap-util --release v1.3.0 --image longhornio/livenessprobe:v2.9.0 --copy --dest_path ezua-v1.3.0/ --options=\"--preserve-digests --retry-times 5\" On this page Requirements About the Air Gap Utility Installing the Air Gap Utility Package Using Air Gap Utility Filters Downloading Air Gap Files Air Gap Utility Logging Using Skopeo --options with the Air Gap Utility Partners Support Dev-Hub Community Training ALA Privacy Policy Glossary Search Search current doc version",

Glossary Definitions for commonly used terms in HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics\n        environments. Identity and Access Management Describes identity and access management in HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software . HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software uses Keycloak\n      as its OIDC provider for identity and access management. Keycloak secures access to HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software and applications\n      through authorization, authentication, and SSO protocols. Users authenticate to Keycloak\n      instead of authenticating to multiple application services. The following steps describe the basic access flow for a user signing in to HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software application\n        services: A user goes to the application URL with their web browser. If the user has not yet signed in to an application in this cluster, the user's browser\n          is redirected to a sign-in page that is managed by the cluster's Keycloak instance. The user enters their credentials (username and password) at the sign-in page. Keycloak verifies the user's credentials against those in the organization's AD/LDAP\n          server. If the provided credentials are valid, the user's browser is redirected to the\n          originally requested application URL. The browser receives one or more cookies. The\n          cookies represent active sessions with Keycloak and the application. The application is (through a secure back channel) provided with an access token that\n          encapsulates the user's authentication and their authorized roles within the cluster. The application internally uses the access token to determine the user's identity and\n          authorization. Some applications may also use this token to communicate with other\n          services within the cluster. Once a user signs in to HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software , SSO enables the user to seamlessly switch between different\n      authentication-requiring application services while the session is valid. For example, the\n      user can open the Feast application without reentering their credentials. However, if the user\n      signs out of HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software and\n      then tries to access the Feast endpoint URL, the OIDC provider (Keycloak) prompts the user to\n      reenter their credentials. If the browser is left idle in the main interface for more than one hour, the user is\n      automatically signed out. If more than one week has passed since the user has authenticated,\n      the user must re-enter credentials. Architecture The following diagram shows two access flows; one for application A and one for application\n        B. Application A is an OIDC-native application that understands how to integrate with a\n        provider such as Keycloak for user authentication and authorization. Application B is not an\n        OIDC-native application. The auth proxy interacts with Keycloak to ensure that access to application B is only\n        available to authenticated users. The proxy also provides information about user identity\n        and roles to application B through HTTP headers. Note that although application A is OIDC-native, it also sits behind the auth proxy. This\n        ensures that, regardless of how the application itself manages sessions and access tokens, a\n        user will be immediately blocked from accessing the application if an admin has revoked the\n        user's cluster access. The following sections describe the components in the access flow diagram: Ingress Istio provides the service mesh, request routing, policy enforcement, and the\n                proxies used to intervene in service requests. The Istio Ingress gateway performs TLS termination for all incoming traffic and\n                validates JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) issued by Keycloak. External client access to\n                application services is TLS-terminated at the Istio Ingress gateway, then routed to\n                internal service endpoints with mutual TLS encryption. Internal service\n                communications also use TLS. Communication to internal services (from the gateway or from applications) is\n                policy-restricted to a set of allowed clients. The clients are identified by SPIFFE\n                credentials. Istio and SPIRE manage the SPIFFE credentials. Routing Istio routes traffic from the Ingress gateway to the appropriate application\n                service based on the DNS name destination of the traffic. During HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software installation,\n                the administrator can set up a DNS domain that includes the entire sub-domain DNS\n                (sub-domain wild card A record) to route all domain traffic to the Ingress of the\n                application environment. Auth Proxy (Oauth2 Proxy) Oauth2 Proxy gates access to applications that are not OIDC aware. It gives those\n                applications information about the user's token and claims in the token by inserting\n                header values (individual claim values as well as the entire token). The primary\n                header values populated by the proxy are: Authorization, from \"Bearer\" prefixed to the entire token in JSON Web Token\n                    (JWT) format X-Auth-Request-Preferred-Username, from the preferred_username claim X-Auth-Request-Email, from the email claim X-Auth-Request-Groups, from the groups claim (Some additional headers are populated with the same username and groups values\n                for backwards compatibility reasons.) Oauth2 Proxy is also used with OIDC-native apps in order to promptly and\n                universally enforce administrative revocation of user access. Oauth2 Proxy hooks into application traffic through Istio authorization policies.\n                The Istio authorization policy forces traffic to go through the proxy before\n                accessing services in HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software . OIDC Client An OIDC client provides a set of API endpoints used for interactions with the OIDC\n                provider, such as authenticating users. The OIDC client instance used by browser-accessed applications in an HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software cluster is\n                represented by the ID ua and a unique generated secret. This secret\n                is passed to application installation scripts during initial setup, then stored in a\n                Kubernetes secret for later use in deploying applications that you import into HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software . For any OIDC-native application that integrates with this OIDC client, Keycloak\n                must be configured to be aware of an application-specific \"callback URL\" that will\n                be used as part of the OIDC flow. For applications imported after initial setup, you\n                must modify Keycloak's list of allowed callback URLs using the Keycloak web\n                interface or REST API. A separate OIDC client with the ID ua-grant (no client secret) is\n                available, which can be used from a CLI or program to directly exchange user\n                credentials for tokens. This client implements the resource owner password\n                  credentials grant flow, or what Keycloak documentation calls Direct Access\n                  Grant . The ua-grant OIDC client is used for two main purposes, both of\n                which apply to REST APIs (or other non-browser service endpoints) exposed to\n                out-of-cluster users: If the service requires token-based authentication, the out-of-cluster caller\n                    can use the ua-grant client to obtain a token which is then\n                    provided to the service. Note that it is the caller's responsibility to securely\n                    store and otherwise manage the token. If the service requires username/password authentication, perhaps because of\n                    constraints from existing service clients, the service can use the ua-grant client internally to validate the user and also\n                    obtain a token that can be used to communicate with other cluster services. OIDC Provider (Keycloak) Keycloak sources user information from the internal or external AD/LDAP directory.\n                Keycloak imports user data from the AD/LDAP server on an hourly basis. The following\n                user attributes are mapped from the AD/LDAP server to Keycloak: username email full name NOTE The specific attribute names representing these three items are provided in the\n                AD/LDAP configuration details when the HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software is installed. Users authenticate with Keycloak instead of authenticating with individual\n                applications. Keycloak assigns a special Keycloak ID to each user and supplies\n                applications with tokens in JWT format. Each token contains claims that\n                describe the user's authenticated identity and other attributes. The claims mapped from the AD/LDAP user attributes, respectively, are: preferred_username email name, given_name, and family_name (The latter two formed by splitting \"name\"\n                    at the first space.) The token also contains a groups claim. This claim contains a list of the\n                user's group memberships that are important to Keycloak or to applications.\n                Currently, the only application-significant group is admin , which is present\n                in the groups list if the user has been designated as an Administrator of the\n                cluster. For additional information about Keycloak, including how to access the Keycloak\n                Admin Web Console, refer to the Keycloak Admin Web Console section in Security . Internal/External AD/LDAP See AD/LDAP Servers and Working with Certs and the Truststore . User Management (Management Operator) An administrator manages users through the HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software UI; for example, creating users and\n                assigning roles. These operations result in the creation of custom Kubernetes\n                resources (representing queries and user configuration) that are processed by the\n                backend user management service. This service has credentials for the Keycloak\n                administrative REST API, the Kubernetes API, and (if applicable) the internal LDAP\n                server. Tasks performed by this service include: Accessing the internal LDAP server to create and delete users. Marking a user in Keycloak to enable or disable their ability to authenticate\n                    into the cluster. Assigning roles to users in Keycloak.

Glossary Definitions for commonly used terms in HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics\n        environments. User Isolation Describes user isolation in HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software . When an HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software administrator adds a new user to HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software , the system automatically assigns each user a user-designated workspace.\n      User-designated workspaces isolate each user's applications and objects from other users in\n      the cluster. If a user wants to share their work, they can do so by setting access controls\n      directly on the objects they create or by changing the namespace in which their applications\n      run. HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software bundles\n      applications with different isolation mechanisms and assurances. For example, HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software bundles cloud-native\n      applications and open-source web applications. Cloud-native applications such as Kubeflow use\n      namespaces to isolate users, whereas web applications such as open-source Airflow and Superset\n      require customized changes to the open-source code to support user isolation and roles in HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software . Customization\n      entails mapping the HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software user role (member or admin) to permissions in the open-source\n      applications. The following table summarizes user isolation in HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software with regard to HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software user roles (admin and member) and application permission\n      mappings, as well as the result of changing user roles and deleting users on applications and\n        objects: MLflow Airflow Superset Spark Admin Assumes admin role View/Edit access on all experiments Does not have personal models or experiments Assumes admin role View/Edit access on all DAGs Does not have personal DAGs Assumes admin role View/Edit access on all dashboards, datasets, and charts Does not have personal dashboards N/A (no role hierarchy in Spark) Can only view/access personal Spark jobs Member Assumes member role Can only view/access personal experiments No access to other users' experiments and models Assumes custom role (segregated) Must explicitly define own role when creating DAGs to keep private; otherwise,\n                    DAGs are shared Assumes customized AlphaDbAccessed role with added permissions to create\n                    database connections Must explicitly define own role when creating DAGs to keep private; otherwise,\n                    DAGs are shared Can view all dashboards and create charts based on all dashboards. Cannot edit the dashboards N/A (no role hierarchy in Spark; similar to Kubeflow) Can only view/access personal Spark jobs Running in user namespace N/A Yes N/A Yes User role propagation Yes Yes Yes N/A (no role hierarchy in Spark) User deletion Objects remain untouched; only admins have access DAGs remain untouched; only admins have access Objects remain untouched; only admins have access Jobs are removed with the user namespace IMPORTANT Do not modify user roles or permissions in the applications\n        that users access through HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software . Modifying roles or permissions directly in an application can break\n        the mapping between the HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software user role and application permission setting. For example, do not\n        assign an HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software member the Admin role in the Superset application. If you want a user to have admin-level\n        permissions in Superset, add the admin role to the user directly in HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software . Changing a user\u2019s\n        role to admin in HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software grants the user access to the Administration settings in HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software . To edit a user role,\n        see Adding Users .

User Roles Describes roles that you can assign to users in HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software . In HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software , a user is\n      either a member or an administrator. The user that installs HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software and applies the license\n      is the platform administrator. After applying the license, the administrator is prompted to\n      sign in using the credentials entered during installation. Once signed in, the administrator\n      can add users. See Adding and Removing Users . Any user added and assigned the admin role can also add and remove users. Users that\n      are not assigned the admin role are members . Members have access to all areas of HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software except for the\n      Administration area. NOTE Admins can only add users that are in the AD/LDAP server.

AD/LDAP Servers Describes the differences between the internal OpenLDAP server in HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software and external AD/LDAP\n    servers. Also describes some of the server-related configuration options that you set during\n    installation. When you install HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software , the configuration options vary depending on whether you use the\n      internal OpenLDAP server (default) included with HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software or an external AD/LDAP server. After installation, the designated administrator can sign in and grant users permission to\n      access HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software and\n      assign roles. A user management operator running in HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software sets up local resources for users, such as their user\n      profile and workspace, and also enables access. NOTE SSO does not support applications that use AD/LDAP integration to validate credentials\n            presented to an external service. The AD/LDAP server supports access by PLAIN (unsecured) LDAP, LDAPS, or StartTLS. Do\n            not use PLAIN LDAP in production. If using LDAPS or StartTLS, one or more custom\n            certificates may be needed to validate the server certificate. See Working with Certs and the Truststore . The following sections describe the differences between internal and external AD/LDAP\n      servers: Internal OpenLDAP Server In HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software , the\n        internal directory setup is an OpenLDAP server. Only use the internal directory for POCs and\n        demos; do not use the internal directory in production. If you opt to use the internal directory, during installation you specify the following\n        information to create the administrator in the system: username full name email password The administrator is the initial user that signs in to HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software to add other users\n        and perform administrative tasks. Adding users creates the internal user directory. When you remove a user, the user can no longer access the HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software cluster, and the\n        system clears the local resources. See Adding and Removing Users . External AD/LDAP Server If you select Use\n          External LDAP Server during installation and configure an external directory, HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software references the\n        external AD/LDAP server and gets users from it. When you sign in to HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software , you can search for\n        users, grant access, and assign roles. HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software has the\n      following external AD/LDAP server requirements: The AD/LDAP server must already exist. The AD/LDAP server must be network-accessible to the deployed HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software instance. For AWS deployments, the AD/LDAP server must be accessible to the VPC where the HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software instance runs. The AD/LDAP server must contain user objects with the required attributes. Any addition,\n          removal, or modification of users and their attributes must be done at the AD/LDAP server. The user objects on the external AD/LDAP server must have the following\n                attributes: Username Fullname Email UID GID Group GID These attributes are required to federate users from the AD/LDAP server to\n                Keycloak. User objects obtained from the direct AD/LDAP integration do not contain\n                any role assignments and does not know which users are enabled to use HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software . When you configure the external AD/LDAP server during installation, you specify the\n        following information: How to contact the LDAP server. How to bind to the server to find account information. Truststore for validating the server certificate. Information about how user objects are configured. The following table lists and describes some of the AD/LDAP fields that you configure\n        during installation: Field Description Active Directory If you do not select the Active Directory (AD) option, the possible schemas\n                  are more varied. You must enter additional information to properly describe the\n                  user and group objects. Validation The validation check boxes are for sanity checks before the installation\n                  starts and during the installation process. The validation can detect issues with\n                  the AD integration server before the installation is well underway. Only disable\n                  these options when running the installation container in an environment that\n                  cannot access AD. Search Base DN Must cover both user and group objects. Security Protocol If the security protocol is LDAPS or StartTLS, the server certificate will be\n                  validated. If the server certificate was signed by something other than a known\n                  public CA, a truststore must be provided. A truststore is a JKS file such as those\n                  created by the Java keytool utility. If a provided truststore is password\n                  protected, the truststore password must be supplied. Username Attribute Must contain the name of a user object attribute on the server that contains\n                  a username following some content rules: Starts and ends with a lowercase letter. Contains only lowercase letters and dashes, for example \"hsimpson\" and not\n                      homer.simpson@mycompany.com. Fullname Attribute Must contain the name of a user object attribute on the server that contains\n                  the user's full name. This is typically the name attribute on AD\n                  servers or cn on OpenLDAP servers. Email Attribute Must contain the name of a user object attribute on the server that contains\n                  the user's email address. Each user must have a unique email address. This is\n                  typically the mail attribute on AD or OpenLDAP servers. UID Attribute GID Attribute For non-AD servers, the UID Attribute and GID Attribute fields name user\n                  object attributes that are expected to contain an integer userID or group ID\n                  value. Similarly for the group GID attribute for group objects. Default Admin User Must identify a user that already exists on the server. The value specified\n                  here should be the value of the Username Attribute on that user object.

Working with Certs and the Truststore Describes how to provide a truststore with a valid server certificate, including how to\n    view and locate certs, as well as how to create and validate a truststore for certs. When you use an external AD/LDAP server, Keycloak verifies the server certificate. If the\n      certificate is not signed by a commonly known certificate authority (CA), you must provide a\n      truststore with the information required to verify that the server certificate is valid. Note the following guidelines and conditions related to certs and the\n      truststore: A truststore is needed for StartTLS or LDAPS connections. Different applications with\n          potentially different default trusted-certificate stores may need to verify the\n          connection, so the means to verify the LDAP server\u2019s certificate must be explicitly\n          provided. A truststore contains the certs required to finish the signing chain \u2013 from the issuing\n          cert mentioned in the cert that the server presents to the trusted self-signed cert. In\n          the case of a self-signed server cert, the chain is the server cert itself. Any truststore that you provide must contain all of the necessary certs. The truststore\n          must be a chain of certs signed by certs that terminate in a self-signed cert. Locating the Certs to put in the Truststore If you do not know which certs need to go into the truststore (possibly due to IT\n        protocols), use openssl to probe the server to see which certs are being\n        presented by the AD/LDAP server. The following commands create the files myserver-cert1.pem,\n          myserver-cert2.pem , and so on. These are the certs presented by the server. The\n        first one is the server cert, followed by any intermediate certs. LDAPS server The following command probes an LDAPS server running at myserver.com on port\n              636 : openssl s_client -showcerts -verify 10 -connect myserver.com:636 < \\ \n    /dev/null | \\ \n    awk '/BEGIN/,/END/{if(/BEGIN/) {a++}; out=\"myserver-cert\"a\".pem\"; print >out}' StartTLS server The following command probes an StartTLS server running at myserver.com on port\n              389 : openssl s_client -showcerts -verify 10 -connect myserver.com:389 -starttls ldap < \\ \n    /dev/null | \\ \n    awk '/BEGIN/,/END/{if(/BEGIN/) {a++}; out=\"myserver-cert\"a\".pem\"; print >out}' Getting the Issuer and Subject from a cert file To get the Issuer and Subject from a cert file, run the following\n                command: openssl x509 -in myserver-cert1.pem -text | grep '\\(Issuer\\|Subject\\)' TIP If there is only one cert and it refers to itself as Issuer, that means it is\n                    a self-signed server cert, and that server cert needs to go into the truststore. If there is a list of Issuers certs, there is typically one Issuer that does\n                    not have a match among the Subjects. That missing Issuer cert is the next link\n                    in the trust chain. You will need to get that cert either by way of the CA, your\n                    IT department, or whoever configured and runs the server. Often the missing\n                    Issuer is a custom root cert, in which case you only have one cert to put in\n                    your truststore. If the missing Issuer is not a root cert and is actually an intermediate cert,\n                    you will need to get the intermediate cert and also get the cert that the\n                    intermediate cert is signed by and continue this process until you get to the\n                    root (self-signed) cert. Creating a Truststore Build the truststore with the Java keytool utility by performing a series\n        of cert imports. Note the following points from the Keystore docs about accepted input cert formats: Keytool can import X.509 v1, v2, and v3 certificates, and PKCS#7 formatted certificate\n            chains consisting of certificates of that type. The data to be imported must be provided either in binary encoding format or in\n            printable encoding format (also known as Base64 encoding) as defined by the Internet RFC\n            1421 standard. In the latter case, the encoding must be bounded at the beginning by a\n            string that starts with \"-----BEGIN\" and bounded at the end by a string that starts with\n            \"-----END\".\" Importing a truststore and setting the password Alias values in the commands are used for readability when dumping the truststore.\n              You can use any alias you choose. The first import creates the truststore. During\n                the first import, you set the password for the truststore. Subsequent imports will\n                ask for this password. To import a self-signed server cert from the servercert.pem file, run the following command: NOTE This is the\n                only command you hae to run for a self-signed\n              certificate. keytool -importcert -alias selfsigned \\ \n    -file servercert.pem -keystore truststore.jks When asked if you want to trust it, respond with yes . Importing a custom root cert and intermediate certs ATTENTION If you follow the instructions to import down the trust\n                chain, you should not be asked whether any of the intermediate certs should\n                be trusted because keytool should be aware of what cert they were signed by. If you\n                get that question when importing an intermediate cert, you may have missed a link in\n                the chain or you are importing in the wrong order. To import a custom root\n              cert and intermediate certs, start by running the following command to import the\n              custom root cert ( root.pem in this\n              example): keytool -importcert -alias root \\ \n    -file root.pem -keystore truststore.jks When asked if you want to trust it, respond with yes . Importing intermediate certs If you have intermediate certs to import, start with the one closest to the root,\n              and work down the signing chain toward the server cert. If your first intermediate\n              cert was signed by a default trusted cert, run the following command to import it\n              (example filename intermediate.pem ): keytool -importcert -trustcacerts -alias intermediate \\ \n    -file intermediate.pem -keystore truststore.jks For any\n                intermediate cert signed by something previously imported into your truststore, run\n                the following command to import it without the trustcacerts argument: keytool -importcert -alias intermediate \\ \n    -file intermediate.pem -keystore truststore.jks Validating a Truststore Run the command appropriate for your server type and then press enter to kill the\n        connection. If the validation is successful, the system returns the following message: Verify return code: 0 (ok) If the truststore is not correct, the system returns the following message: Verify return code: 20 (unable to get local issuer certificate) LDAPS To validate a truststore, run the following command: NOTE The following example\n              validates that a truststore named truststore.jks with password mypass works for an LDAPS server running at myserver.com port 636 as follows: openssl s_client -verify 10 -connect myserver.com:636 \\ \n    -CAfile <(keytool -list -rfc -keystore truststore.jks -storepass mypass) StartTLS To validate a truststore, run the following command: NOTE The following example\n              validates that a truststore named truststore.jks with password mypass works for an LDAPS server running at myserver.com port 389 as follows: openssl s_client -verify 10 -connect myserver.com:389 -starttls ldap \\ \n    -CAfile <(keytool -list -rfc -keystore truststore.jks -storepass mypass) On this page Locating the Certs to put in the Truststore Creating a Truststore Validating a Truststore Partners Support Dev-Hub Community Training ALA Privacy Policy Glossary Search Search current doc version",

Glossary Definitions for commonly used terms in HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics\n        environments. Adding and Removing Users Programmatically Describes how to add and remove users through the Kubernetes API using the EzUserQuery\n    and EzUserConfig custom resources. The user management operator in HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software responds to the\n      EzUserQuery and EzUserConfig custom resources when they are created by a client with the\n      required Kubernetes API permissions. Use the administrative kubectl config that you get when you create the HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software cluster to onboard and manage users programmatically\n      through the Kubernetes API. To onboard a user, complete the following steps: Use the EzUserQuery custom resource to search for the user in the internal or external\n          AD/LDAP directory. The EzUserQuery returns a list of attributes for a user, including the\n          Keycloak ID. The Keycloak ID is required to onboard a user. Use the EzUserConfig custom resource to onboard the user. The following sections describe the custom resources: EzUserQuery Use the EzUserQuery custom resource to query the user AD/LDAP directory. The EzUserQuery properties map directly to the query types of the Keycloak user API.\n        Providing values for the email , firstName , lastName , and/or username properties sets criteria that must match the returned users. The search property value is typically the most useful and can match against the email or username . Keycloak returns the query response and the status updates. The query results are bounded\n        and a query only returns up to five results. Narrow your search criteria to reduce the\n        number of results returned. Results show you attributes for the user, for example if they\n        are enabled (true/false), id (keycloak user ID), and role (admin or not). EzUserQuery resources self-delete after they expire. Using the EzUserQuery Custom Resource In a YAML file, add the following properties, specifying your own\n                  values: apiVersion: ezconfig.hpe.ezaf.com/v1alpha1\nkind: EzUserQuery\nmetadata:\n  name: my-query-1\nspec:\n  search: joel To create and get the query, run the following commands, specifying your YAML\n                  file name: kubectl create -f query.yaml\n\nkubectl get ezuserquery A ready status indicates that there are query results. This is the status.status property. To query the AD/LDAP directory, run the following command, specifying your query\n                    name: kubectl get ezuserquery my-query-1 -o yaml The\n                    command returns results similar to those shown in the following image: The userQuery property\n                    displays the user attributes. EzUserConfig Use the EzUserConfig custom resource to enable/disable users and manage user roles. EzUserConfig identifies the user (via keycloak ID) and indicates the roles that a user\n        should have when onboarded. The following table describes the differences between internal and external AD/LDAP servers\n        when using EzUserConfig: AD/LDAP Server Type Description Internal EzUserConfig creates and enables a user. Deleting an\n                  EzUserConfig disables and deletes the user. External EzUserConfig enables a user. EzUserConfig identifies the user (via\n                  Keycloak ID) and sets the user role. Deleting an EzUserConfig disables the user. The EzUserConfig status stanza shows user attributes, whether the user is\n        successfully enabled, the roles that have successfully been assigned, and any error\n        messages. TIP The user management operator actually onboards the user. Enabled is not a role that you can assign to a user. To show existing ezuserconfigs ,\n              run: kubectl get ezuserconfig Using the EzUserConfig Custom Resource In a YAML file, add the following properties, specifying your own\n                  values: apiVersion: ezconfig.hpe.ezaf.com/v1alpha1\nkind: EzUserConfig\nmetadata:\n  name: my-admin-user-1\nspec:\n  id: 04ef844e\n  roles:\n    - admin Note that the ID is the Keycloak ID that you can get using the\n                  EzUserQuery custom resource. To see a list of all the attributes for a user, run the following command,\n                  specifying the name of the user you want to see attributes\n                  for: get ezuserconfig joel -o yaml The command returns\n                  results similar to those shown in the following image: On this page EzUserQuery EzUserConfig Partners Support Dev-Hub Community Training ALA Privacy Policy Glossary Search Search current doc version",

Managing Data Access HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software administrators\n      have unrestricted access to all the data sources and underlying schemas, tables, views, and\n      buckets. Admins can grant members the following types of access to data sources, schemas,\n      tables, views, and buckets. Read Write Read & Write Admins can grant public access to a data source such that all HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software members have full\n      access (read, write, and execute) to all the data within the data source. Alternatively,\n      admins can grant one or more members access to specific schemas, tables, views, or buckets\n      within a data source. Any access granted can also be revoked by an admin. When members do not have access to a data source, the data source appears greyed out on the\n      screen. Members cannot access any of the data within that data source. Any attempts to access\n      the data results in an access denied error. Members should contact their HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software admin to request access\n      to data. The following sections provide the steps for granting and revoking access to data sources,\n      schemas, tables, and views. Granting a Member Access to Data HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software administrators can grant a member access to one or more tables, views, or buckets in a\n        schema. To grant a member access to data, complete the following steps: Sign in to HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software . In the left navigation bar, select Administration > Identity & Access\n            Management . On the Identity and Access Management screen, locate the user. In the Actions column of the user row, click the three-dots and select Manage\n            Privileges . On the Manage Privileges screen, select the Structured Data or Object\n            Store Data tab, depending on the type of data that you want to grant the user access\n          to. Expand a data source and select a schema. In the Datasets area, select the tables, views, or buckets that you want to grant\n          the user access to. You can grant Read , Write or Read & Write access. If you are only granting the user access to a single table, view, or bucket, use the Access Type column dropdown in the row of the table, view, or bucket. If you are granting the user access to multiple tables, views, or buckets, use the Bulk Access dropdown to the right of the Search field, and select the\n              access type you want to grant the user on all of the selected tables, views, or\n              buckets. Click Update Privilege . The system displays the message: Updated\n              privileges for the user: <user-name> Granting All Members Access to a Data Source (Public Access) HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software administrators can make a data source publicly accessible. When an admin makes a data source\n        publicly accessible, all members have full access (read and write) permissions on the data\n        source and the data within it. To make a data source publicly accessible, complete the following steps: Sign in to HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software . In the left navigation bar, select Data Engineering > Data Sources . Select the Structured Data or Object Store Data tab. In the data source tile, click the three-dots. Select Change to public access . In the Data Access dialog, click Proceed or Cancel . If you chose to\n          proceed, the system displays the message: Access changed for the data source:\n              <data-source-name> Revoking Member Access to Data HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software administrators can revoke a member's access to schemas, tables, views, and buckets. Revoking\n        access makes the data inaccessible to the member. To revoke member access to data, complete the following steps: Sign in to HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software . In the left navigation bar, select Administration > Identity & Access\n            Management . On the Identity and Access Management screen, locate the user. In the Actions column of the user row, click the three-dots and select Manage\n            Privileges . On the Manage Privileges screen, select the Structured Data or Object\n            Store Data tab, depending on the type of data that you want to revoke access\n          to. Expand the data source and select the schema that contains the data you want to revoke\n          access to. In the Datasets area, select the tables, views, or buckets that you want to\n          revoke access to. If you are only revoking access to one table, view, or bucket, select No\n                Access in the Access Type column for the table, view, or bucket. If you are revoking access to multiple tables, views, or buckets, select the tables,\n              views, or buckets and then use the Bulk Access dropdown (to the right of the Search field) and select No Access . Click Update Privilege . The system displays the message: Updated\n              privileges for the user: <user-name> Revoking Public Access to a Data Source HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software administrators can revoke all access to a ata source. Revoking public access to a data\n        source makes the data in the data source totally inaccessible to all members. Only admins\n        can access the data source and the data within it.

Glossary Definitions for commonly used terms in HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics\n        environments. Expanding the Cluster Describes how to add additional user-provided hosts to the management cluster to increase resource capacity and how\n    to expand the cluster to include the additional user-provided hosts. Expand the cluster when applications cannot run due to resource limitations, such as lack of\n      vCPU. When applications do not have enough resources to run, the system raises an\n      alarm to alert you of the issue. In such cases, the HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software administrator and system administrator can work together\n      to add additional user-provided hosts to the pool of machines in the management cluster\n      (control plane nodes) and workload cluster to increase the processing capacity of the cluster. The following steps outline the cluster expansion process: An application triggers an alert to users that it does not have sufficient resources to\n          run. Users contact the system administrator to request additional resources (add additional user-provided hosts to\n          the management cluster). A system administrator adds user-provided hosts to the cluster, as described in the section Adding User-Provided Hosts to the Cluster . After the system administrator adds user-provided hosts to the cluster, the HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software administrator signs into the HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software UI and expands the\n          cluster, as described in the section Expanding the Cluster . Adding User-Provided Hosts\n        to the Cluster You can only add user-provided hosts to the cluster. User-provided hosts are machines that\n        meet the installation prerequisites, as described in Installation Prerequisites . TIP If you want to use the high-availabilty (HA) feature when you expand the cluster,\n              note that HA requires three master nodes. You must add two hosts to the ezfabric-host-pool with the controlplane role. If you want to increase the VCPU or VGPU resources when you expand the cluster, you\n              must add worker hosts or GPU hosts with enough resources (VCPU or VGPU) to ezfabric-host-pool with the worker role. SSH into the VM that launched the installation UI when you installed HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software . This is the VM\n            that launched the installation UI when you ran the installation UI script\n              ( ./start_ezua_installer_ui.sh ), as described in Run the Installation Script to Access the Installer Web UI . To run a bash session in the UI installer Docker container on the VM, issue the\n            following command: docker exec -it hpe-ezua-installer-ui bash Create a /tmp/expand directory: mkdir /tmp/expand\ncd /tmp/expand Copy the following files into the /tmp/expand directory and create an add_host.yaml file in the /tmp/expand directory: cd /tmp/expand\ncp /tmp/ezkf-orchestrator/mgmt-kubeconfig ./mgmt-kubeconfig\ncp /root/ezua-installer-ui/ezfabricctl_linux_amd64 ./ezfabricctl\ncp /tmp/hostPoolConfig.yaml ./add_host.yaml Edit the /tmp/expand/add_host.yaml file: IMPORTANT Do not change the defaultHostCredentials object. The sshPassword for the defaultHostCredentials must be a base64 encoded string. For example, if your password is abcde12345! , converting it to a base64 encoded string changes\n                  it to YWJjZGUxMjM0NSE= . Under the hosts: object, remove the worker and/or control plane\n                nodes that are listed from any previous action. Add the new worker and/or control planes nodes. In the following example, node\n                  10.10.10.123 is specified as the control plane node being added to the host pool,\n                  and node 10.10.10.223 is being specified as the worker node being added to the\n                  host pool: defaultHostCredentials:\n  sshUserName: root\n  sshPassword: YWJjZGUxMjM0NSE=\n  sshPort: 22\nhosts:\n- host: 10.10.10.123\n  labels:\n    role: controlplane\n- host: 10.10.10.223\n  labels:  \n    role: worker Make ezfabricctl executable: chmod +x ezfabricctl NOTE The ezfabricctl command-line program is available in the installer UI\n              Docker container. The installer UI invokes this program for cluster expansion. To add the new node(s) to the pool, run the following\n            command: ./ezfabricctl poolhost init --input add_host.yaml --kubeconfig mgmt-kubeconfig To check node status: SSH in to the Ezmeral Coordinator . The Ezmeral Coordinator is the node that orchestrates the deployment of HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software instances,\n                  as described in Node Setup . TIP If you need to identify the Ezmeral Coordinator node, run the\n                    following command: kubectl get nodes --kubeconfig <ezmeral-coordinator-kubconfig-file> To verify that the hosts were added to the hosts pool, run the following command: kubectl get ezph -A The system returns output similar to the\n                  following: NAMESPACE               NAME            CLUSTER NAMESPACE     CLUSTER NAME     STATUS     VCPUS   UNUSED DISKS  GPUS\nezfabric-host-pool      10.10.10.1      ezkf-mgmt             ezkf-mgmt        Ready      4\t  2             0\nezfabric-host-pool      10.10.10.223      \t                               Ready      4\t  2             0\nezfabric-host-pool      10.10.10.123       \t                               Ready      4\t  2             0 NOTE In the kubectl command that you run, ezph is the abbreviated version of ezpoolhosts , an Ezmeral resource that runs against the host\n                  pool. Expanding the Cluster In a user-provided host\n        configuration, the hosts within the pool (namespace) must have enough vCPUs and vGPUs for\n        the cluster expansion to succeed. If you request more vCPUs and vGPUs than are available,\n        the cluster expansion will fail. ATTENTION If repeated attempts\n          to expand the cluster fail with an \" already complete \" message, delete any existing\n          EzkfOpsExpand custom resources on the workload cluster before you expand the cluster. To\n            identify the EzkfOpsExpand custom resources, run the following\n            command: kubectl get ezkfopsexpand -A \n# (lists the Expand CR names and namespaces) For each of the EzkfOpsExpand\n            custom resources listed in the output, run the following\n            command: kubectl delete ezkfopsexpand -n <expand_CR_namespace> <expand_CR_name> To expand the cluster, complete the following steps: In the left navigation bar, select Administration > Settings . On the Cluster tab, select Expand Cluster . In the Expand Cluster drawer that opens, enter the following information: Number of additional vCPU to allocate. For example, if the current vCPU is 96 and\n              you add 4 vCPU, the vCPU increases to a total of 100 vCPU. Select Use GPU if you want to use GPU and it is not already selected. If Use GPU was selected during installation of HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software , this option\n              cannot be disabled and stays selected by default. Indicate the additional number of vGPU to allocate. For GPU configuration, if a size was selected during HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software installation,\n              you cannot change the size. However, if no vGPU size was selected during installation,\n              you can select a size now. For additional information, see GPU Support . If HA was selected during HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software installation, you cannot disable it. If it was not selected\n              during installation, you can select it now. Currently HA is available for the workload\n              cluster only. You cannot set HA for the management cluster. Click Expand . Configuring HPE MLDE for Added GPU Nodes If you add GPU nodes to the cluster after installing HPE MLDE , you must perform additional steps to ensure HPE MLDE works on these nodes.

Glossary Definitions for commonly used terms in HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics\n        environments. Shutting Down an HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software Cluster Describes how to gracefully shut down an HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software cluster when you want to perform maintenance or upgrade\n    tasks. A typical HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software cluster consists of three or more nodes. Three nodes are specifically designated as data\n      fabric nodes. If your cluster has exactly three nodes, you can simply run the edf\n        shutdown cluster command from the admincli pod to gracefully\n      shutdown the HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software cluster, as described in Shutting Down Data Fabric Nodes . If your HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software cluster\n      has more than three nodes, the cluster consists of both data fabric and non-data fabric nodes.\n      In this case, first identify the data fabric nodes and take note, as described in Identifying Data Fabric Nodes . Shut down the non-data fabric nodes using a\n      standard Linux shutdown command or UI power down in the case of AWS, as described in Shutting Down Non-Data Fabric Nodes . Once you have shut down the non-data fabric\n      nodes, run the edf shutdown cluster command from the admincli pod to gracefully shutdown the HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software cluster, as described\n      in Shutting Down Data Fabric Nodes . After you shut down the cluster and perform maintenance or upgrade tasks, restart the\n      cluster, as described in Restarting an HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software Cluster . IMPORTANT HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software does not support graceful shutdown for installations that use the\n        internal directory (OpenLDAP server). Users added to the HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software internal directory\n        (OpenLDAP server) will not persist beyond the shutdown and restart, making it impossible for\n        any user to access the system. Requirements Shutting down an HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software cluster requires: Access to the Kubernetes cluster Admin access in the HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software cluster Identifying Data Fabric Nodes If the cluster consists of more than three nodes, identify the data fabric nodes. The data\n        fabric nodes have a CLDB service running on them. The CLDB service is a proprietary data\n        fabric service that only runs on data fabric nodes. Run the following command to identify the data fabric nodes: kubectl get pods -n dataplatform -o wide| grep cldb Shutting Down Non-Data Fabric Nodes After you have identified the data fabric nodes, run a standard Linux shutdown command or\n        UI power down in the case of AWS. For example, run the following Linux command on the\n        non-data fabric nodes to shut them down: shutdown [OPTIONS] [TIME] [MESSAGE] Shutting Down Data Fabric Nodes Use the edf shutdown cluster command to gracefully shut down the data\n        fabric nodes and reboot pods. The edf shutdown cluster command shuts down\n        the data fabric nodes in an ordered process to prevent certain components from restarting.\n        Pods are immediately put into a wait state after the reboot to prevent them from becoming\n        operational. You must run the edf shutdown cluster command from the admincli pod of the HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software cluster. To log in to the admincli pod and shut down the data fabric nodes, run the\n        following command: kubectl exec -it admincli-0 -n dataplatform -- edf shutdown cluster Restarting an HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software Cluster Complete the following steps to restart the cluster: To log in to the admincli pod and restart the data fabric nodes, run\n            the following command: kubectl exec -it admincli-0 -n dataplatform -- edf startup resume To check the status of the nodes, run the following\n            command: kubectl get pods mcs-0 -n dataplatform When the mcs pod READY column shows 1/1 ,\n            the cluster is fully operational.

Version: Enter the framework version. Description: Enter the application description. Category: Select the application category from Data\n                                                  Engineering, Analytics, or Data Science. Framework Icon: Click Select File and\n                                                  browse the logo image for your application. Framework Chart: Set the following boxes\n                                    on the Framework Chart step: Helm Chart: Select Upload New Chart to\n                                                  import a new application. A list of all previously\n                                                  imported applications appears in the dropdown. If\n                                                  you deleted the previously imported application\n                                                  and you want to import the same application again,\n                                                  you can choose that application option from the\n                                                  dropdown.

When you set this value to true , it initiates the start of\n                                                  an init container that changes the owner of the\n                                                  PersistentVolume mount point. When you set this value to false , the permissions remain\n                                                  unchanged, which prevents the creation of the\n                                                  directory, thus causing the container to fail. Upload Helm Package tar.gz file: Click Select File and\n                                                  browse the tar.gz of your\n                                                  application Helm chart. Namespace: Enter the namespace for framework. Release Name: Enter the name for this specific installation of\n                                                  Helm Chart. Wait: To wait until all the necessary services,\n                                                  volumes, pods, are in ready state before\n                                                  successfully importing the applications, check Wait . Debug: To get detailed information in error status,\n                                                  check Debug .

Glossary Definitions for commonly used terms in HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics\n        environments. Automatic Downloads of Framework Updates Describes how to automatically upgrade tools and frameworks included with the HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software installation. Prerequisites: Sign in to HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software as an administrator. You can upgrade applications by enabling automatic downloads of framework updates, so that\n      the application tile on the Tools & Frameworks screen shows an Upgrade button indicating that a new Helm chart is available or the Tools & Frameworks update bundle will be displayed on the Available Updates table. To upgrade frameworks by enabling automatic downloads, follow these steps: In the left navigation bar, click Administration \u2192 Settings . Click Updates \u2192 Download Updates . To enable the automatic download of framework updates, toggle Enable\n            automatic downloads of framework updates . NOTE To disable automatic download\n            of framework updates, toggle Disable automatic downloads of framework\n              updates . After enabling the automatic downloads of framework updates, you have two choices: Batch framework updates : To upgrade frameworks simultaneously when new\n              versions are available, use batch framework updates. To learn more, see Batch Framework Updates . Individual framework updates : To upgrade frameworks sequentially(one at a\n              time) when new versions are available, use individual framework updates. To learn\n              more, see Individual Framework Updates . Batch Framework Updates If frameworks have updates available for a new version, every hour HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software bundles those updates\n        and displays the update bundle on the Available Updates table as Tools & Frameworks . NOTE The table in Available\n            Updates is updated every hour whereas if there are any new versions of\n          frameworks, you can see the Upgrade button is enabled for that\n          framework immediately in the Tools & Frameworks screen for\n          individual framework updates. Once you see the Tools & Frameworks update bundle, you can click\n        the bundle to view details. In the Details dialog box, you can see\n        the name, description, the current version of the framework and chart, and the new available\n        version for the framework and chart. Once you see the new available versions for the update,\n        you can perform the following actions by clicking on the Actions menu. Update To batch update frameworks immediately, follow these steps: Click Update in the Actions menu. This will open an Update Now dialog box and you can\n                    compare the current and new available versions of frameworks for upgrade. Click Update Now to immediately start framework\n                    updates. Wait for framework updates to be in the In\n                      Progress status. NOTE You cannot cancel framework updates once it\n                      is in the In Progress status. Result: You can navigate to the Tools &\n                  Frameworks screen to see frameworks are now in the Upgrading status. Schedule To schedule batch framework updates for later, follow these steps: Click Schedule in the Actions menu. This will open a Schedule Update dialog box and you can compare the\n                    current and new available versions of frameworks for upgrade. Select a date and time to schedule the update. Wait for framework updates to\n                    be in the Scheduled status. Once the framework updates are in the Scheduled status,\n                    you can perform the following actions from the Actions menu. Cancel You can cancel the scheduled updates any time before update starts or\n                            if updates are not in the In Progress status\n                            yet. Reschedule You can reschedule the scheduled updates any time before update starts\n                            or if updates are not in the In Progress status\n                            yet. Update You can update frameworks immediately even though it has been scheduled\n                            for a later date and time. Viewing Update History Once your updates are complete, the Tools & Frameworks update details will be displayed in the Update History table. You can click Tools & Frameworks to view details. In the Details dialog box, you can see the name, description, the\n                current version of the framework and chart, and the new available version for the\n                framework and chart. Individual Framework Updates To update frameworks one at a time, follow these steps: Click Tools & Frameworks in the left navigation bar. If there are any new versions of frameworks, you can see the Upgrade button is enabled for that framework. An enabled Upgrade button only appears if the version of the framework\n              currently installed is older than the version available. For example, if a new version\n              of Airflow is available, you see the Upgrade button enabled in the application tile for Airflow . Click Upgrade to complete the upgrade for that framework. Repeat steps 1 and 2 to update all frameworks of your choice. Failure and Rollback When you are upgrading frameworks, if one of the framework updates fails, the application\n        tile for that framework will be in the Error status and the failed\n        application will be rollbacked to the previous version from which you were upgrading to the\n        new version. For example: In HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software , if you upgraded ten frameworks and nine frameworks are upgraded and\n        in the Ready status, and if one farmework upgrade failed and is in\n        the Error status with a warning message on the framework tile, then\n        only that failed application is rolled back to the previous version whereas nine frameworks\n        are successfully upgraded to new versions. If for some reason the rollback fails and the framework is in the error state, you must\n        contact HPE support to resolve this issue.

Configuring Endpoints Describes the endpoints in HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software and how to configure them. Configure endpoints in HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software by going to Administration > Settings and\n      selecting the Configurations tab. The following sections provide details for each type of endpoint on the Configurations tab: OTel Endpoint The OTel endpoint is the target URL where HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software OTel exporter sends logs and metrics. The OTel endpoint\n        enables other OTel collectors to receive cluster metrics and logs in OTel format. When you register an OTel endpoint, the cluster OTel collector exports metric and log data\n        to the customer OTel collector hosted at the OTel endpoint. This includes Prometheus metrics\n        about cluster performance, billing/metering related data, and app-based metrics for\n        Kubeflow, Spark, and Ray. Cluster logging data from Fluent Bit is also sent. You can also\n        export the incoming data to tools, such as Grafana or Elasticsearch. OTEL is the standard format for metrics collection. Data only persists for 60 days in\n        prometheus. Use the following OTel endpoint format: <host>:<port> The OTel endpoint format: Must be a valid HTTPS host May contain a port Should contain a path Cannot contain other parts, such as a query string or fragment JDBC Endpoint The JDBC endpoint is automatically created when you install and configure HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software . To connect EzPresto to external applications,\n        see Connect to External Applications via JDBC . EzCentral Forwarding NOTE EzCentral Forwarding is not supported for\n          air-gapped (disconnected) environments. In HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software , you can\n        opt-in to forward your metrics collected by Prometheus to EzCentral via OTEL in real-time. EzCentral is a platform managed by HPE that can monitor your HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software clusters\n        when you enable EzCentral Forwarding. The metrics forwarding to EzCentral has the following\n        benefits: Fast resolution of cluster issues by HPE through efficient cluster management and\n          administration. Provides real-time alerts to HPE enabling immediate incident resolution. Enables HPE to warn you regarding unhealthy clusters and take actions to resolve\n          issues.

GPU Support Provides information about support for NVIDIA GPU, MIG partitioning, preparing hosts\n    for GPU-enabled environment, adding hosts and enabling GPU in HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software . GPUs provide essential computational power and parallel processing capabilities to accelerate\n      the training and inference processes of deep learning models, reading and processing data\n      frames, processing SQL queries within Spark, and running experiments using Jupyter notebooks\n      integrated with GPUs. The hundreds or thousands of smaller cores working in parallel enable GPUs to process massive\n      amounts of data in a short period of time. HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software supports single-access multi-instance GPU. You can\n      use MIG GPU when there are multiple applications that require GPU acceleration. By using MIG,\n      you can achieve higher resource utilization and cost efficiency. Supported GPU Models To see the GPU models supported by HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software , see GPU Models . MIG Partitioning HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software supports homogenous configuration deployment where\n        the GPU is split into N equal parts with the same amount of memory and CUDA cores. All GPU\n        models on the same Kubernetes cluster must operate in the same MIG mode or in the same\n        configuration mode. HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software does not support any mixed\n        configuration across multiple GPU models. In HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software , GPU partitions are presented as whole devices\n        by using the MIG mechanism. When an application requests one GPU, the application receives a\n        partition. Only one GPU device is visible to the application. To learn more, see CUDA visible devices . During the installation of HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software , you must specify GPU\n        partition size (Whole, Large, Medium, and Small) and request the number of GPU instances\n        required for the workload. You cannot change the GPU partition size later. For A100 GPU, the partition size will map to the following profiles: To learn about MIG profile names, see MIG Device Names . Unified Analytics vGPU Size No. of Unified Analytics vGPUs per physical GPU MIG Profile - A100-40GB MIG Profile - A100-80GB Description Whole 1\u2013100% No MIG - entire physical GPU No MIG - entire physical GPU A100 GPU models are not split into any partitions. You will get the entire physical GPU. In this configuration, applications can use only one virtual GPU at a time. Large 2 \u2013 42% each 3g.20gb 3g.40gb A100 GPU models are split into two equal partitions. In this configuration, 16% of the GPU will remain idle. Medium 3 \u2013 28% each 2g.10gb 2g.20gb A100 GPU models are split into three equal partitions. In this configuration, 16% of the GPU will remain idle. Small 7 \u2013 14% each 1g.5gb 1g.10gb A100 GPU models are split into seven equal partitions. In this configuration, 2% of the GPU will remain idle. NOTE Once you select a specific partition size, you cannot change this configuration after\n          installation. Preparing the GPU Environment HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software supports GPUs on Kubernetes nodes. The underlying\n        hosts must be running an operating system and version that is supported on the corresponding\n        version of HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software . HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software supports user-provided deployment. Preparing hosts to use GPU in the user-provided host model: If you want to use GPU in HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software , you will have to prepare\n        your hosts. The following are the requirements for preparing your hosts before installation\n        to use GPU in HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software : The host can be bare metal or VM with GPU pass-through, or an AWS EC2 instance. Install the latest version of the supported operating system. To learn about the\n            supported operating system versions for GPU in HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software ,\n            see Operating System . NOTE Do not use operating systems\n              with pre-installed NVIDIA drivers. HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software does not\n              support operating systems with pre-installed NVIDIA drivers. The GPU operator\n              automatically installs NVIDIA drivers when the host is added to HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software . Disable SELinux on the host before adding the host to HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software . This is the NVIDIA limitation, see GPU Operator with RHEL8/SELinux . NOTE After successfully\n              adding the host to HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software cluster and the successfull\n              NVIDIA driver install through the GPU operator, you can enable SELinux on that host\n              and set it to enforcing mode. To learn more about user-provided hosts, see Installing on User-Provided Hosts (Connected and Air-gapped Environments) . Environments Description vSphere VM Configure the VMs in the GPU pass-through setup by following the steps in VMware setting up GPU pass-through documentation. Add hosts to the HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software . AWS Use the AWS account with access to provision GPU-based instances (p4d.24xlarge,\n                    and p4de.24xlarge EC2 instances). Deploy the A100 EC2 instance (P4d instance) with the AMI image in the supported\n                    operating system. Add hosts to the HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software . Adding Hosts and Enabling GPU Environment After you have prepared hosts to work in the GPU-enabled environment, you must add them to\n        the HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software during the installation or during cluster\n        expansion. After adding the host, the GPU is enabled automatically. Adding Hosts and Selecting GPU Environment During Installation To add hosts and select the GPU environment in the cluster during installation,\n              follow these steps : Perform the installation instructions provided in the installation documentation\n                  for your deployment target until you reach the Installation\n                    Details step in the installation wizard. See Installation . In the Installation Details step, to enable the GPU, check Use\n                    GPU . vGPU: Specify the vGPU instances for your\n                        cluster. The number of vGPUs allocated depends on the GPU configuration\n                        partition size, the number of added GPU worker hosts, and the number of GPU\n                        cards per host. The number of allocated vGPUs may be less than the number of\n                        requested vGPUs. For example: If one A100 GPU host is added with two\n                        GPU cards with the following configurations: vGPU request: 10 vGPUs vGPU configuration: large Then the number of allocated vGPUs is as follows: vGPUs allocated: 2 x 2 large per GPU card = 4 GPU Configuration: Specify the GPU partition\n                      size. NOTE Once you select a specific partition size or specify the number of GPU\n                      instances, you cannot change this configuration after installation. As each node is added to the HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software inventory node pool, HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software configures the MIG profile if it detects\n                    MIG-capable devices (e.g., A100). To specify the details for other boxes or options in the Installation Details step and to complete the cluster\n                    installation, refer to the installation documentation for your deployment\n                    target. See Installation . Adding Hosts and Selecting GPU Environment During Cluster Expansion To add hosts and select the GPU environment in the cluster during cluster expansion,\n              follow these steps: Perform the steps to expand the cluster until you reach the Expand\n                    Cluster screen. See Expanding the Cluster . To enable the GPU, in the Expand Cluster screen, check Use GPU . NOTE If you enabled the Use\n                      GPU option during the cluster installation, then that means GPU is\n                    already enabled and you cannot disable the Use GPU option\n                    while expanding the cluster. vGPU: Specify the additional vGPU instances for your\n                        cluster. NOTE The number of additional vGPUs allocated depends on the GPU\n                        configuration partition size, the number of added GPU worker hosts, and the\n                        number of GPU cards per host. The number of  allocated vGPUs may be less\n                        than the number of requested vGPUs. GPU Configuration: Specify the GPU partition size. NOTE If you selected the partition size during the cluster installation,\n                        you can not update the partition size while expanding the\n                      cluster. To specify the details for other boxes or options in the Expand\n                      Cluster screen and to complete the cluster expansion, see Expanding the Cluster .

Glossary Definitions for commonly used terms in HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics\n        environments. GPU Resource Management Describes the GPU idle reclaim policy used for GPU resource management. GPU resource management enables you to optimize the analytical workloads by distributing the\n      GPU resources to various workloads so that each workload receives the necessary computing\n      power. HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software implements the GPU idle reclaim feature to maximize\n      GPU utilization by dynamically allocating and deallocating resources to different frameworks\n      and workloads as needed. This prevents overallocation and underutilization of the GPU\n      resources and increases efficiency. GPU resource management uses a priority policy to ensure that critical workloads get the\n      resources they need while also allowing lower-priority workloads to utilize the GPU when it is\n      available. When a workload or framework is finished using its GPU resources, HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software initiates GPU resource reclamation. This involves\n      deallocating the resources and making them available for other workloads. Custom Scheduler HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software runs its own scheduler which functions\n        independently and is not connected to the default Kubernetes scheduler. Note that the default Kubernetes scheduler is still available alongside this custom\n        scheduler. The custom scheduler is an enhanced version of the default Kubernetes scheduler\n        that includes the GPU idle reclaim plugins and the preemption tolerance. The custom scheduler plugin governs all GPU workloads and is installed in the hpe-plugin-scheduler namespace. This namespace consists of a controller\n        and a scheduler module. The scheduler is responsible for scheduling and reclaiming. There are two pods in the scheduler namespace. They are scheduler-plugins-controller-dc8fbd68-2plns and scheduler-plugins-scheduler-5c9c5579cb-xz48q . You can see logs of\n          the scheduler-plugins-scheduler-5c9c5579cb-xz48q pod to find details of\n        the GPU reclamation and pod preemption. To see the logs,\n          run: ks logs -f scheduler-plugins-scheduler-5c9c5579cb-xz48q -n hpe-plugin-scheduler Custom Scheduler Configurations HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software sets the default configurations for the tools and\n        frameworks supporting GPU workloads so that the custom scheduler is used by default. The\n        following tools and frameworks support GPU workloads: Kubeflow Spark Livy Ray HPE MLDE Every GPU workload for Kubeflow, Spark, Livy, Ray, and HPE MLDE have the following\n        configurations set as part of their pod spec to use the custom scheduler by default. schedulerName: scheduler-plugins-scheduler priorityClass: <app_name>-<component_name>-gpu For example, For Kubeflow notebooks: kubeflow-notebook-gpu For Spark: spark-gpu (Note: There is no component name for\n                    Spark) Only pods with their spec.schedulerName set to scheduler-plugins-scheduler are considered for reclaiming. You must not modify these configurations for the GPU reclamation. If your GPU pod spec is\n        not set to scheduler-plugins-scheduler , the default Kubernetes scheduler\n        will operate instead of the custom scheduler. The scheduler runs a cron job every 5-10 minutes. Every 5-10 minutes, the scheduler looks\n        at the running pods and determines the feasibility of reclaiming pods based on their GPU\n        usage and the annotation values set in the priority class attached to the pod. If the pod is\n        eligible for preemption, the GPU is reclaimed, and the pending pods are granted resources.\n        Pods without any GPU usage or idle pods grant their resources to the pending pods. NOTE Workloads with an idle GPU will not be preempted unless there is a pending request\n          from another workload for GPU. GPU Configurations In HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software , you can configure the priority level and idle time threshold from the GPU Control Panel screen.\n        However, you cannot configure the toleration seconds and GPU usage threshold for workloads. To learn more about GPU control panel, see Configuring GPU Idle Reclaim . Priority class and priority level HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software attaches priority classes as pod specs to the\n              deployed pods to prioritize pods. The priority class has a number called priority level that determines the importance of a pod. The custom scheduler determines the priority based on this priority level. The\n              default priority level for all pods is 8000. You can set the priority level from 8000-9999 where 8000 is the lowest priority level\n              and 9999 is the highest priority level. You can update the priority level for your\n              applications and workloads from the GPU Control Panel screen. Idle time threshold You can also set the idle time threshold for GPU from the GPU Control Panel\n              screen. The idle time threshold for GPU means the maximum amount of time a GPU\n              can remain idle without running any workloads. If a GPU remains idle for a duration\n              exceeding this threshold, then the GPU on those workloads can be reclaimed to make the\n              GPU available for other workloads. Toleration seconds Toleration seconds is the minimum number of seconds the pod or workload needs\n              to run before it can be preempted. The default toleration seconds is set to 300\n              seconds. GPU usage threshold The GPU usage threshold is the level of GPU utilization. The default usage\n              threshold is set to 0.0. If any pod has a GPU usage of greater than 0 in the last 300\n              seconds, it cannot be preempted. For any pods to be preempted, the usage must be\n              0.0. Configuring GPU Idle Reclaim Describes how to configure the GPU idle reclaim, view pod details, and view GPU         usage.

For example, a pod\n                                with the 8000 priority level will have a low priority compared to\n                                the pod with the 9999 priority level. Default priority level: 8000 Idle Time Threshold Set the maximum amount of time a vGPU on a workload can be idle\n                                before that workload can be preempted (deallocated) automatically by\n                                a pending workload.

Glossary Definitions for commonly used terms in HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics\n        environments. GPU Scheduling Workload Scenarios Describes GPU scheduling workload scenarios and the notebook example for GPU idle\n    reclaim. In HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software , you can encounter the following GPU scheduling\n      workload scenarios during the GPU idle reclamation. GPU Idle Reclaim In HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software , consider two GPU workloads, denoted as Workload1 and Workload2 . Currently, Workload1 is running and is in an idle state while Workload2 is pending due to lack of available GPU resources. In this\n        scenario, if the idle duration of Workload1 exceeds an idle time threshold, Workload1 is preempted in favor of Workload2 . Following\n        the preemption, Workload1 goes into a pending state, while Workload2 is allocated GPU resources and starts running. Active GPU Usage In HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software , consider two GPU workloads, denoted as Workload1 and Workload2 . Currently, Workload1 is running and is using GPU resources while Workload2 is pending due to lack of available GPU resources. The custom\n        scheduler runs a cron job every 5-10 minutes to determine the eligibility of reclaiming pods\n        based on their GPU usage and the annotation values set in the priority class attached to the\n        pod. If the GPU usage for Workload1 is greater than 0.0, Workload1 cannot be preempted in favor of Workload2 . In\n        this scenario, Workload1 will continue to run and utilize the GPU resources\n        without interruption. If the GPU usage for Workload1 is equal to 0.0 and if the idle duration of Workload1 exceeds an idle time threshold, Workload1 is\n        preempted in favor of Workload2 . Following the preemption, Workload1 goes into a pending state, while Workload2 is\n        allocated GPU resources and starts running. Priority Scheduling In HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software , consider three GPU workloads, denoted as Workload1 , Workload2 , and Workload3 .\n        Currently, Workload1 is running and is in an idle state, Workload2 is pending due to lack of available GPU resources, and Workload3 has the highest priority among the three workloads and is\n        pending due to lack of available GPU resources. In this scenario, if the idle duration of Workload1 exceeds an idle time threshold, Workload1 is\n        preempted in favor of Workload3 . Following the preemption, Workload1 goes into a pending state, Workload3 is\n        allocated GPU resources and starts running, and Workload2 will continue to\n        be in the pending state. Notebook Example for GPU Idle Reclaim Consider a scenario in which HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software is configured with a\n        single physical GPU. In this scenario, you have chosen the small vGPU size, which includes 7\n        vGPUs. Each application will always have a maximum of one vGPU assigned to it. Now, assume you have seven notebook servers, denoted as idle-gpu-notebook , used-gpu-notebook-1 , used-gpu-notebook-2 , used-gpu-notebook-3 , used-gpu-notebook-4 , used-gpu-notebook-5 , and used-gpu-notebook-6 . In this\n        scenario, the idle-notebook-gpu notebook server has an idle GPU with no GPU\n        usage while the six other notebook servers are actively using GPU resources. You can navigate to the GPU Control Panel screen to check the status\n        of these notebook servers. There you can see that one notebook server has an Idle status and the six others have a Running status. You can click Notebooks to view the details of each notebook server.\n        You can confirm that the idle notebook has no GPU usage, and six others have an active GPU\n        usage by clicking the GPU utilization chart icon in the Actions menu. Consider you create another GPU-enabled notebook server, denoted as test-idle-notebook-2 . As the GPU usage for idle-gpu-notebook is equal to 0.0, as soon as the idle duration of idle-gpu-notebook exceeds an idle time threshold, idle-gpu-notebook is preempted in favor of test-idle-notebook-2 . Following the preemption, idle-gpu-notebook goes into a pending state, while test-idle-notebook-2 is allocated GPU resources and starts running.

Glossary Definitions for commonly used terms in HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics\n        environments. Spark Describes how to identify and debug issues for Spark. Spark History Server Long-running Spark applications exceed disk\n              quotas for Spark History Server. Repeatedly running long-running Spark applications generates a large volume of logs\n                in the Spark History Server event log directory. This can exceed disk quotas,\n                causing failures in other Spark applications. You must monitor log sizes and manage\n                disk space to mitigate this issue. Workaround To prevent the exceeding of disk quota for the Spark History Server event log\n                directory, modify the Spark History Server configuration options as follows: To periodically clean up event logs from storage,\n                set: spark.history.fs.cleaner.enabled true To delete job log files older than the specified value,\n                set: spark.history.fs.cleaner.maxAge 1d Here, job log files\n                that are older than 1d are deleted by the filesystem history cleaner. To specify the frequency for the filesystem job history cleaner to check for the\n                files to be deleted,\n                set: spark.history.fs.cleaner.interval 12h Here, the filesystem\n                job history cleaner checks every 12h for files to be deleted. NOTE If the disk quota is full, contact HPE support for assistance. Spark Operator Spark application submission hangs or fails. If the Spark application submission hangs or fails, check the submission pod\n                  state. If the pod is in the pending state, wait for more resources to be\n                    available. If the pod is in the failed state, collect pod logs and contact Hewlett Packard Enterprise . Spark application hangs in the Submitted or Running state. If the Spark application hangs in the Submitted or Running state, check the state of the driver pod. If the driver pod is in the ContainerCreating state, check the\n                  pod events. If the image is downloading, wait until the image is downloaded. For the FailedMount reason, you need to identify what\n                      volume is missing. By default, all Spark workloads submitter pods are preconfigured to\n                          mount system volumes such as Spark History Server PVC, user PVC, and\n                          shared PVC. If the problem is with the system volume, contact Hewlett Packard Enterprise . If the driver pod is in a Running state, check if executor\n                      pods are in a Running state as well\u200b. Sometimes executor pods are in a pending\n                      state due to a lack of resources, in this case, wait for the resources to be\n                      available. For other reasons, collect driver and executor pod logs and contact Hewlett Packard Enterprise . Spark application fails. If the Spark application fails, collect the driver pod logs. If the container fails before running the application code, contact Hewlett Packard Enterprise as there is a problem with the image. If the container fails while the application is running, check the exception\n                    in a driver log:\u200b For the functional exception (e.g. NullPointerException), review the\n                        application source code\u200b. For the non-functional exception (e.g. OutOfMemoryError), increase memory\n                        allocation for the driver pod and/or review the application source\n                        code\u200b. Livy Livy session creation fails. If the Livy session fails, create a Livy session with the default configuration and\n                run. If it runs successfully, check the configuration of your failed Livy session for\n                  configuration issues. If it fails, collect the Livy server pod logs and driver pod logs (if available)\n                  and contact Hewlett Packard Enterprise . Livy session hangs in the Starting state. Verify that the driver pod is not in the Pending or\n                  ContainerCreating state. Livy statement run hangs or fails. If the Livy statement run hangs or fails, Analyze the error message and fix the statement. For a detailed error message\n                    information, go to the Livy Server UI. Verify the executor pods are not in the Pending state.\n                    For the Livy statements to run, executor pods must be available. For other reasons, collect driver and executor pod logs and contact Hewlett Packard Enterprise . Livy session disappears. No action required as this is an expected behaviour for the idling sessions.

Glossary Definitions for commonly used terms in HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics\n        environments. Security Describes how to identify and debug issues related to security. Internal Network Connection issue SPIRE is currently implemented to rotate certificates that secure mTLS traffic internally\n        right now. The SPIRE server has two containers in it. If SPIRE elements are down, this could\n        be the source of an internal network connection problem. You can check to see if SPIRE is\n        logging for a particular node. SPIRE pods are in the SPIRE namespace, including one agent per node. In the SPIRE server pod, the spire-controller-manager container is the most beneficial to\n        check for\n        logs: kubectl -n spire logs -l app=spire-server -c spire-controller-manager Oauth-2-proxy Pod in CrashLoopBackOff Error State The container in the oauth-2-proxy pod started, but crashes and repeatedly\n        restarts incorrectly. To resolve this issue, update the DNS A record with the node IP\n        address where the Istio Ingress gateway pod was deployed. You can get the node IPs on the\n        Status page of the HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software installer. Authentication If authentication is not working, check to see if pods are running and check pod logs. You\n        may just need to kill a pod and restart it on a healthy node. For more complicated issues,\n        you may need to collect some logs and talk to HPE support. The following table provides pod information and commands you may want to run if\n        authentication is not working: Component Information Internal OpenLDAP server The server runs the ldap-0 pod in the hpe-ldap namespace. You can access the ldap-0 pod with the following internal service DNS\n                    name: ldap-svc.hpe-ldap.svc.cluster.local:389 If you\n                    need to bind it to read some users, use the following DN and\n                    password: cn=readonly,dc=example,dc=com\npassword: mapr Search from the following\n                    base: ldapsearch -Y EXTERNAL -Q -H ldapi:/// -b ou=users,dc=example,dc=com You\n                    can also exec into the ldap-0 pod and use ldap * local utilities like ldap search to\n                    investigate what the internal LDAP server looks like. Oauth-2 proxy HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software uses Oauth2 proxy for authentication. Oauth2 runs in the oauth-2-proxy namespace. To get the pod logs, run the\n                    following command: kubectl -n oauth2-proxy logs -l app=oauth2-proxy Keycloak HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software uses a local instance of Keycloak as its OIDC provider. Keycloak runs in the keycloak namespace in the keycloak-0 pod.\n                  There is also a PostgreSQL pod running in the namespace that stores the\n                  configuration and current known user information. Keycloak pod logs show login\n                  attempts and any AD/LDAP integration errors. To view the Keycloak logs,\n                    run: kubectl -n keycloak logs keycloak-0 Keycloak/LDAP User Authentication Test Use a direct grant endpoint to see if a user can authenticate to Keycloak. Run this test on\n        the command line to verify that the AD/LDAP integration is working for a particular user and\n        that the password is correct. This test hits a client in Keycloak that allows the direct\n        grant on the authentication flow. This test is not doing a web-based redirect flow; it is\n        just saying give me your credentials for a token in return. Run this test on the command line and then go to https://jwt.io/ : USER=<username>\nPASS=<password>\nDOMAIN=<your-domain>.com\nRESULT=$(curl -k --data \"username=$USER&password=$PASS&grant_type=password&client_id=ua-grant\" https://keycloak.$DOMAIN/realms/UA/protocol/openid-connect/token)\nACCESS_TOKEN=$(echo $RESULT | sed 's/.*access_token\":\"//g' | sed 's/\".*//g') You can also use the direct grant endpoint for REST API endpoints that must accept and\n        validate username and password credentials. The direct grant endpoint can validate the\n        incoming username and password and get an access token. The remainder of the flow inside HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software is based on\n        the access token. Keycloak Admin Web Console The Keycloak Admin Web Console is useful for finding and resolving issues. To access the\n        Keycloak Admin Web Console, you will need the system master's kubectl privileges that you got when you first installed and created the HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software cluster. This is\n        required to get the password for the keycloak administrator. To access the Keycloak Admin Web Console: Go to keycloak.<your-UA-domain> . Enter admin as the user. Enter the password. You can get the password with kubectl and kube.config : kubectl -n keycloak get secret admin-pass -o jsonpath=\"{.data.password}\" | base64 -D\u200b NOTE For\n            Linux, use base64 -d . For Mac, use base64\n          -D\u200b . In the left navigation bar of the Keycloak UI, switch over to the UA realm . To find all users: In the left navigation bar, select Users . On the User list tab, enter * in the search field to see all known users. To modify roles for a particular user: NOTE This process can be useful if someone deletes\n          the HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software admin\n          users in the AD server. The user whose role you modify may need to sign out of HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software , and sign back in\n          for the change to take effect. On the Users page, search for the user and click on the username . Select the username in the User list . On the user's page, select Role Mapping . Select the role that you want to assign to the user. To change how users sign in (email vs username): In the left navigation bar, go to Realm Settings > Login tab . On the Login tab , select the Login with email switch. Duplicate emails\n            turns off automatically when you do this. This is safe to do for external AD/LDAP\n            servers. For internal AD/LDAP servers, you can also turn this on, but there are no guard\n            rails on the internal user management to prevent duplicate emails. If this happens, one\n            of the users will not be able to log in. To manually grant or remove the ua-enabled role: NOTE The ua-enabled role is the internal role that grants access to HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software . If the user object\n          does not have this role in Keycloak, they cannot authenticate and get access to HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software applications.\n          However, this does not do all the user onboarding and offboarding that the user management\n          operator does; it merely prevents access to HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software . Setting this role in Keycloak should only be used\n          in special or emergency circumstances. In the left navigation bar, select Users . Search for the user and select the user. On the user's page, select the Role Mapping tab. Select ua-enabled . To see the LDAP settings that identify the source of the HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software user directory: In the left navigation bar, select User federation . On the LDAP page, select the Settings tab . You can change the following settings: How Keycloak batch requests to the remote server. How often Keycloak synchs users from the server; the default is hourly. NOTE You should\n            not modify the settings you entered through the HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software installer, such as the server address.\n            Changing those settings here can have negative consequences because this is not the only\n            place that those settings are stored. Keycloak uses the LDAP information, but so do some\n            of the other HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software applications. Currently, it is best not to change LDAP settings\n            because it can break applications that depend on them. Bad HTTP Request When a custom framework expects HTTPS traffic, the following error displays when you try to\n        access the service in the\n        browser: 400 Bad Request - The plain HTTP request was sent to HTTPS port. To\n        resolve this issue, add a DestinationRule in addition to the VirtualService, as shown in the\n        following examples. DestinationRule Example apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1\nkind: DestinationRule\nmetadata:\n  name: {{ include \"test-app.fullname\" . }}\n  namespace: {{ .Release.Namespace }}\n  labels:\n    {{- include \"test-app.labels\" . | nindent 4 }}\n\n #The URL should point to the corresponding service. \n #Kubernetes provides an internal DNS mapping for services using the format <ServiceName>.<ServiceNamespace>.svc.cluster.local. \nspec:\n  host: {{ include \"test-app.fullname\" . }}.{{ .Release.Namespace }}.svc.cluster.local\n  trafficPolicy:\n    tls:\n      mode: SIMPLE VirtualService\n        Example apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3\nkind: VirtualService\nmetadata:\n  name: {{ include \"test-app.fullname\" . }}\n  namespace: {{ .Release.Namespace }}\n  labels:\n    {{- include \"test-app.labels\" . | nindent 4 }}\nspec:\n  gateways:\n    - {{ .Values.ezua.VirtualService.istioGateway }}\n  hosts:\n    - {{ .Values.ezua.VirtualService.endpoint }}\n  #The following VirtualService options are specific and depend on the application implementation.\n  #This example is a simple application with single service and simple match routes.\n  #The URL should point to the corresponding service. \n  #Kubernetes provides an internal DNS mapping for services using the format <ServiceName>.<ServiceNamespace>.svc.cluster.local. \n  http:\n    - match:\n        - uri:\n            prefix: /\n      rewrite:\n        uri: /\n      route:\n        - destination:\n            host: {{ include \"test-app.fullname\" . }}.{{ .Release.Namespace }}.svc.cluster.local\n            port:\n              number: {{ .Values.service.port }} On this page Internal Network Connection issue Oauth-2-proxy Pod in CrashLoopBackOff Error State Authentication Keycloak/LDAP User Authentication Test Keycloak Admin Web Console Bad HTTP Request Partners Support Dev-Hub Community Training ALA Privacy Policy Glossary Search Search current doc version",

User Interface Describes how to identify and debug issues related to the HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software UI. Installer UI Does Not Show Ingress Gateway Node IP Addresses (Required for DNS A Record\n        Configuration) When you install HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software , you need the ingress gateway node IP addresses to configure your DNS\n        A record for access to the HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software domain. However, due to a port conflict that can occur between the\n        istio ingress gateway and OpenShift ingress, the HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software installer UI may not display the ingress gateway node\n        IP addresses after the installation completes. When this conflict occurs, the istio\n        ingressgateway pods go into a pending state, and the function that\n        retrieves the node IPs returns empty. To resolve this issue, complete the following steps: SSH into the HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software master node or have access to the kubeconfig of\n            the HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software cluster. To identify the nodes running the OpenShift ingress pods, run: kubectl get pod -n   openshift-ingress -o wide Example [core@master0 ~]$ kubectl get pod -n   openshift-ingress -o wide\nNAME                             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   IP               NODE                        NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES\nrouter-default-b6c47bcf6-5nlcm   1/1     Running   0          37h   10.227.209.134 worker2.pooja.ezfab.local <none>           <none>\nrouter-default-b6c47bcf6-w7vcv   1/1     Running   0          38h   10.227.209.135   worker3.pooja.ezfab.local   <none>           <none>\n[core@master0 ~]$ To identify the nodes with the \"ezkf.hpe.com/ingress-gateway=true\" label,\n              run: kubectl get node --show-labels | grep ingress-gateway NOTE The\n              conflict occurs on the node(s) running OpenShift ingress pods that also have the \"ezkf.hpe.com/ingress-gateway=true\" label. Example [core@master0 ~]$ kubectl get node --show-labels | grep ingress-gateway worker2.pooja.ezfab.local Ready    worker                 46h   v1.25.16+5c97f5b   beta.kubernetes.io/arch=amd64,beta.kubernetes.io/os=linux,ezkf.hpe.com/ingress-gateway=true,hpe.com/compute=true,hpe.com/dataplatform=true,hpe.com/exclusivecluster=none,hpe.com/pin-dataplatform-cldb=true,hpe.com/pin-dataplatform-zk=true,hpe.com/status=available,hpe.com/usenode=true,kubernetes.io/arch=amd64,kubernetes.io/hostname=worker1.pooja.ezfab.local,kubernetes.io/os=linux,node-role.kubernetes.io/worker=,node.openshift.io/os_id=rhcos,nvidia.com/gpu.deploy.operands=true\nworker4.pooja.ezfab.local   Ready    worker                 46h   v1.25.16+5c97f5b   beta.kubernetes.io/arch=amd64,beta.kubernetes.io/os=linux,ezkf.hpe.com/ingress-gateway=true,hpe.com/compute=true,hpe.com/dataplatform=true,hpe.com/exclusivecluster=none,hpe.com/status=available,hpe.com/usenode=true,kubernetes.io/arch=amd64,kubernetes.io/hostname=worker4.pooja.ezfab.local,kubernetes.io/os=linux,node-role.kubernetes.io/worker=,node.openshift.io/os_id=rhcos,nvidia.com/gpu.deploy.operands=true In this example output, the conflicting node is worker2.pooja.ezfab.local because this node has the OpenShift ingress\n            pod running and also has the label. The \"ezkf.hpe.com/ingress-gateway=true\" label on this node must be\n            deleted and then added to a different worker node. On each node with the conflict, complete the following steps: To remove the label,\n                  run: kubectl label node <nodename> ezkf.hpe.com/ingress-gateway- NOTE The - at the end of ingress-gateway- is included\n                  to indicate deletion of the label. To list all worker nodes,\n                  run: kubectl get node Example [core@master0 ~]$ kubectl get node\nNAME                        STATUS   ROLES                  AGE   VERSION\nmaster0.pooja.ezfab.local   Ready    control-plane,master   46h   v1.25.16+5c97f5b\nmaster1.pooja.ezfab.local   Ready    control-plane,master   46h   v1.25.16+5c97f5b\nmaster2.pooja.ezfab.local   Ready    control-plane,master   46h   v1.25.16+5c97f5b\nworker0.pooja.ezfab.local   Ready    worker                 46h   v1.25.16+5c97f5b worker1.pooja.ezfab.local Ready    worker                 46h   v1.25.16+5c97f5b\nworker2.pooja.ezfab.local   Ready    worker                 46h   v1.25.16+5c97f5b\nworker3.pooja.ezfab.local   Ready    worker                 46h   v1.25.16+5c97f5b\nworker4.pooja.ezfab.local   Ready    worker                 46h   v1.25.16+5c97f5b worker5.pooja.ezfab.local Ready    worker                 46h   v1.25.16+5c97f5b Identify one worker node that does not have the ingress gateway or the \"ezkf.hpe.com/ingress-gateway=true\" label and then run the\n                following command to add the label to that\n                node: kubectl label --overwrite node <nodename>  ezkf.hpe.com/ingress-gateway=true In\n                the example, the following nodes qualify as worker nodes that could have the \"ezkf.hpe.com/ingress-gateway=true\" label\n                added: worker0.pooja.ezfab.local\nworker1.pooja.ezfab.local\nworker5.pooja.ezfab.local To verify that there are two running istio-ingressgateway pods,\n              run: kubectl get pod -n istio-system NOTE An OpenShift cluster\n              with three worker nodes has only one \u200b istio-ingressgateway pod in the Running state. To get the ingressgateway IPs, run: kubectl -n istio-system get pod -l app=istio-ingressgateway -o jsonpath='{.items[*].status.hostIP}' Use\n              the IP address to configure the DNS A records. UI Sign-Out/Timeout Causes Issues in Open Applications If you explicitly sign out of the HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software UI or the system signs you out because the session hit the idle\n        duration limit, you may experience issues in the other applications that you opened through\n        the HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software UI in the\n        same session, or you may see the following message: Bad Message 431 Reason: Request Header Fields Too Large To prevent or resolve this issue, follow these recommendations: If you are not working directly in the HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software UI, close the UI tab to avoid having the system\n          automatically sign you out. When you explicitly sign out of the HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software UI, close all of the application tabs that you opened\n          through the UI. If you get the 431 message, clear the browser cookies for that particular HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software cluster.

Enhancements Elevated Security with Advanced Access Management HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software introduces a dual-layered approach to access management through access token renewal\n                and expiration. Within a user's workspace in a Unified Analytics cluster, automatic token renewal allows them to seamlessly engage in prolonged\n                activities, minimizing disruptions in their workflows. Concurrently, each access\n                token is set to expire quickly; if a token is obtained by some other party through\n                an exploit, the window in which it can be used to act as the authorized user is\n                minimized. This enhancement strengthens the overall security posture, instilling users with\n                increased confidence in safeguarding their analytics workloads and ensuring a secure\n                computing environment. Installation Experience In this release, the upgraded HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software installation experience introduces a \u201cPrecheck\u201d\n                feature in the UI. You can now leverage the precheck option to run a preliminary\n                assessment of hardware and host requirements. This proactive step identifies and\n                addresses any potential issues or discrepancies before initiating the setup process\n                for a more efficient and reliable Unified Analytics installation\n                experience.

Known Issues The following sections describe known issues with workarounds where applicable: Update the SPIFFE CSI driver After installing and deploying HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software , run the following command to update the SPIFFE CSI\n                driver: kubectl -n spire set image ds spire-spiffe-csi-driver spiffe-csi-driver=ghcr.io/spiffe/spiffe-csi-driver:0.2.5 After a reboot, the Unified Analytics hosts may not be ready\n                due to an issue with the SPIFFE CSI driver; updating SPIFFE CSI may resolve it. For\n                details, see Host (Node) Management . EzPresto does not release memory when a query completes EzPresto retains allocated memory\n                after query completion for subsequent queries because of an open-source issue ( https://github.com/prestodb/presto/issues/15637 ).\n                For example, if a query uses 10GB of memory, EzPresto does not release the memory when the query completes and then\n                uses it for the next query. If the next query requires additional memory, for\n                instance, 12GB, EzPresto accumulates an extra 2GB and does not release it after query completion. For\n                assitance, contact HPE support. Configuration changes to long-running pods are\n              not applied in Ray Configuration changes or upgrades to long-running pods in Ray, such as adjusting\n                resource capacities or expanding persistent volume (PV) storage are not applied in\n                Ray. Workaround To ensure successful configuration changes or upgrades, manually delete relevant\n                pods after the reconfiguration or upgrade process. For details, see https://github.com/ray-project/kuberay/issues/527 . Worker nodes do not automatically spawn with JobSubmissionClient in the Ray cluster When submitting jobs to the Ray cluster using JobSubmissionClient ,\n                worker nodes do not spawn automatically. Workaround To ensure proper functionality when submitting Ray jobs using JobSubmissionClient , you must manually specify entry point\n                resources as follows: For CPU, set entrypoint_num_cpus to 1 For GPU, set entrypoint_num_gpus to 1 For details, see Using JobSubmissionClient to Submit Ray Jobs . HPE is actively engaging with the community to address this open-source issue\n                  ( https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues/42436 ). Installation of Unified Analytics on Azure -PPH may get\n              stuck Installation of Unified Analytics on Azure -PPH may get stuck\n                because of a slower disk. A faster read/write disk (such as SSD) may overcome the\n                issue. Installer UI does not display the ingress gateway node IP addresses In rare instances, the installer UI might not display the ingress gateway node IP\n                addresses post installation. These IP addresses are needed for configuring the DNS A\n                record. If you encounter this issue, please refer to the provided guidelines here to\n                retrieve the IP address. For details, see User Interface . Long-running Spark applications exceed disk\n              quotas for Spark History Server Repeatedly running long-running Spark applications generates a large volume of logs\n                in the Spark History Server event log directory. This can exceed disk quotas,\n                causing failures in other Spark applications. You must monitor log sizes and manage\n                disk space to mitigate this issue. For details, see Spark . NVIDIA GPU Cannot Enforce SELinux Due to a known NVIDIA GPU issue ( https://github.com/NVIDIA/gpu-operator/issues/553 ),\n              SELinux cannot be enforced for GPU deployments. Workaround Set GPU hosts to either disabled or permissive mode until this issue is resolved. Ray Dashboard UI A known Ray issue prevents the Ray Dashboard UI from displaying the GPU worker group\n              details correctly. To see updates regarding resolution and to learn more, see https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues/14664 . Spark Magic To leverage Spark magic ( %manage_spark ) on Jupyter Notebooks for\n              interactive Livy on GPU, users must manually configure GPU settings\n                ( %config_spark ). For details, see Enabling GPU Support for Livy Sessions . Installation Fails due to Insufficient GPU/CPU The installation process fails if the installation requests more GPU/CPU resources\n              than are available.

Glossary Definitions for commonly used terms in HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics\n        environments. Metering and Billing Describes metering and billing in HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software . Metering involves the measurement and collection of metrics from monitored targets. The\n      metering process is essential for billing purposes and to monitor the usage of key resources\n      within the Kubernetes cluster, such as pods, PVCs, and jobs. Prometheus facilitates the\n      monitoring of these components. Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting system designed for gathering\n      time-series data. Prometheus provides a flexible querying language (PromQL) to retrieve and\n      analyze metrics. HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software consists of platform components and application\n      components such as Kubeflow, Airflow, and others. In HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software ,\n      metering refers to tracking the resource usage, particularly CPU and\n        GPU usage of the components. Metering is used to support accurate billing and to\n      observe the aggregated usage of these components over a specific time period. There are four categories of component workloads (pods): Application core workloads The application core workloads are initialized by the application installer. These\n              workloads allows the instantiation of user-initiated workloads, such as notebooks and\n              jobs. Some examples of these workloads include notebook controllers, EzPresto core querying workloads, and inference job\n              controllers. Application user workloads The application user workloads refers to the user-initiated workloads. Some examples\n              of these workloads include notebooks, inference jobs, Spark jobs etc. Infrastructure or platform workloads The platform workloads perform core platform functions such as monitoring UI,\n              managing users, connecting to Data Fabric, and so on. Bring your own application workloads Bring your own application workloads refers to the workloads that are imported using Import Applications functionality. You must manually specify\n              the labels for workloads in the workload resource yaml files. Configure the resource metadata with the following labels: hpe-ezua/type=\"vendor-service\" hpe-ezua/app=\"<name_of_the_app>\" Pod labels are used to categorize each workload into the four types of workloads. CPU usage\n      is measured every five seconds. After obtaining the initial data, application-related pod\n      labels are used to retrieve the aggregate application usage. For example, the total Kubeflow\n      usage can be calculated by summing up the usage of all pods associated with Kubeflow. Billing and Metering In HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software , billing is performed on an hourly basis. A cron\n        job runs at the top of each hour to compute the average of the aggregated application usage.\n        Daily and monthly aggregations are also calculated, and custom metrics are pushed back to\n        Prometheus. The billing feature leverages these custom metrics to calculate monthly\n        charges. Dashboard An administrator can view the Billing & vCPU Usage dashboard on the HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software homepage. An overview of\n                the daily and monthly aggregated usages for applications is available through the Billing & vCPU Usage dashboard. In this dashboard, you see the daily usage for the Overall category, which includes all applications, including imported applications. To view\n                the resource usage charts for a specific application, select the application from\n                the dropdown. The left side provides the total estimated charges for the month with the daily\n                breakdown. The right side, displays the usage data. In HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software , GPU usage is metered per\n                application and each vGPU counts as an individual GPU for metering. GPU metrics used for metering is DCGM_FI_PROF_GR_ENGINE_ACTIVE\u200b . GPU metrics sampling interval is every five seconds\u200b. The hourly usage is the average GPU utilization over a one hour\n                period\u200b. For example: With 7 small vGPUs and 4 applications using 6 vGPUs as\n                  follows: Applications Pods -vGPU Avg 1hr per vGPU Avg 1hr utilization per application App1 Pods11 - vGPU0 0.8 1.3 Pods12 - vGPU1 0.5 App2 Pods21 - vGPU2 0.8 0.8 App3 Pods31 - vGPU3 0.5 0.5 App4 Pods41 - vGPU4 0 0.5 Pods42 - vGPU5 0.5 Total GPU utilization for billing record is \u200b 1.3 + 0.8 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 3.1\n                vGPU-hour\u200b Top Frameworks provides the list of monthly aggregated usage\n                charges data for all applications in HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software . The total usage for billing is aggregated for all included and imported\n                applications.

Model monitoring is the process of continuously observing and analyzing the performance and\n      behavior of machine learning models deployed in production environments. It is a critical\n      aspect of the machine learning lifecycle that ensures models remain reliable, accurate, and\n      aligned with the intended objectives. Model monitoring involves the collection, analysis, and visualization of various metrics and\n      data related to the model's performance and data characteristics. It is an iterative process\n      that helps ensure model reliability and enables timely adjustments or updates to maintain\n      optimal performance. Model monitoring plays a crucial role in building trust in machine\n      learning systems and making informed decisions based on model outputs. Model monitoring metrics are essential to track and measure the performance of the deployed\n      models. In HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software , you can use KServe or MLflow for monitoring\n      operational performance and whylogs for functional performance. Collected Metrics Knative metrics Knative Serving does not have built-in native support for model monitoring metrics.\n                You can integrate Kserve with other monitoring and observability tools to collect\n                and analyze metrics related to the performance and behavior of your deployed\n                models.(Prometheus, Grafana, Kiali, ESK etc) To learn more, see Importing dashboards to Grafana . The following metrics are collected via KServe: Knative Serving: Revision HTTP Requests Knative Serving: Scaling Debugging Knative Serving: Revision CPU and Memory Usage Knative: Reconciler Knative Serving: Control Plane Efficiency MLflow metrics Use OTel to collect and export the telemetry data from MLflow applications,\n                including metrics, traces, and logs, to third-party or external monitoring systems\n                such as Prometheus, Jaeger, or Grafana for analysis and visualization. To learn\n                more, see Configuring Endpoints . The following metrics are collected via MLflow: mlflow_http_request_total : Total number of incoming HTTP\n                    requests. mlflow_http_request_duration_seconds_sum : Total duration in\n                    seconds of all incoming HTTP requests. mlflow_http_request_duration_seconds_count : Total count of\n                    all incoming HTTP requests. Model Monitoring with whylogs NOTE This feature is presented as a developer preview. Developer preview are not tested for\n          production environments, and should be used with caution. whylogs is an open-source library for logging any kind of data. With whylogs, you can\n        generate summaries of your datasets (data profiles) that you can use to: Track changes in the dataset and detect data drifts in the model input features. Create data constraints to validate data quality in model inputs or in a data\n            pipeline. Detect training-serving skew, concept drift, and model performance degradation. Perform exploratory data analysis of massive datasets. Track data distributions and data quality for ML experiments. Standardize data documentation practices across the organization.

Logging Describes how logging works in HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software and how to\n    access log files for the platform and applications. Logging is crucial for monitoring and troubleshooting applications and the cluster\n      infrastructure. Logs capture, collect, and store data generated by applications, containers,\n      and Kubernetes components running in a Kubernetes cluster. In HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software , you can easily access log files to monitor and troubleshoot issues. Log Rotation Logs are automatically rotated to ensure that the shared 1 directory does not exceed the limit of 10 MB per file to prevent storage issues. When the\n        file size surpasses 10 MB, the old copy is retained, and a new log file is created,\n        effectively managing storage and keeping it under control. NOTE Only one old copy of 10 MB\n          is retained at any time. For example, the airflow-ui.log undergoes renaming as airflow-ui.log.1 when it exceeds 10 MB in size. Simultaneously, a new log\n        file named airflow-ui.log is created. Similarly, if the size of the new airflow-ui.log file exceeds the 10 MB threshold, the current airflow-ui.log.1 log file is replaced with the new logs from the airflow-ui.log file. This log rotation process ensures efficient\n        management of log files while maintaining the specified size limit. 1 The shared directory is persistent volume storage shared by\n        all users. Accessing Log Files To access the log files: Sign in to HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software . In the left navigation bar, go to Data Engineering > Data\n              Sources . Select the Data Volumes tab. On the Data Volumes tab, select the shared folder. In the shared folder, select the logs/ directory. The logs/ directory contains the following subdirectories with logging data: apps/ Contains platform and application component logs. If you open this directory, it\n                  contains the following subdirectories: app-core/ Contains logs for core application pods. app-user/ Contains logs for user-initiated pods such as notebooks, inference jobs,\n                        Spark jobs, and others. platform/ Contains infrastructure pod logs. audit/ Contains the native Kubernetes audit logs. The native Kubernetes audit logs\n                  record requests made to the Kubernetes API server, such as which users or services\n                  requested access to cluster resources and why the requests were authorized or\n                  rejected. system/ Contains system node service logs.

Data Engineering Data engineers can design and build pipelines that transform and transport data into\n    usable formats for data consumers. HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software includes\n      connectors for several data sources that facilitate data virtualization by providing a single\n      point of uniform, controlled access to distributed data, regardless of the compute engine. \n      You can use open-source tools, such as Apache Spark and Apache Airflow, to extract data from\n      disparate sources and create transformed data sets for data consumption. For example, you can run a Spark job to move data from one data source (such as Snowflake)\n      into another data source (such as HPE Ezmeral Data Fabric ) and then connect HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software to the HPE Ezmeral Data Fabric data source. Once connected to HPE Ezmeral Data Fabric , you can work with the data (join and transform) to create\n      consumable models for users and applications. Data consumers with appropriate permissions can use\n      data in their analytical workloads, data science workflows, dashboards, or for data\n      modeling. Working with Data The Data Engineering space provides access to interfaces that enable you to use EzPresto , the SQL query engine in HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software , to work with data. The following list describes what you can do through each of the interfaces in the Data\n        Engineering space: Data Sources Connect HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software to external data sources. Each connected data source displays as\n              a tile on the screen. You can also remove data sources or access the Query Editor from\n              each data source tile. See Connect Data Sources . When you connect HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software to\n                various data sources, you can access the data in those data sources from Superset and then visualize the data. Data Catalog Select data sets (tables and views) from one or more data sources and run federated\n              queries. You can also cache data sets. Caching stores the data in a distributed\n              caching layer within the data fabric for accelerated access to the data. See Cache Data . Query Editor Run queries against the selected data sets. You can also create views and new\n              schemas. Cached Assets Lists the cached data sets (tables and views). See Cache Data .

Accessing Data in External S3 Object Stores Describes how to access data in external object stores from clients, such as Spark and\n    Kubeflow notebooks. After an administrator connects HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software to an external object store in AWS, MinIO, or HPE Ezmeral Data Fabric Object Store , you can access data in those data sources through clients, such as\n      Spark or Kubeflow notebooks, without providing an access key or secret key. Your HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software administrator provided\n      the access credentials when creating the data source connection. Your access to the data\n      source is authorized through HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software . To connect a client to an object store, you provide the client with the data source name,\n      endpoint URL, and bucket that you want the client to access. You can find the data source name\n      and endpoint URL on the data source tile in the HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software UI. Once connected, clients can: Read and download files in a bucket Upload files from a bucket Create buckets Getting the Data Source Name and Proxy Endpoint URL To get the data source name and proxy endpoint URL: Sign in to HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software . In the left navigation bar, select Data Engineering > Data Sources . On the Data Sources page, find the tile for the object store you want to connect\n          to. The following image shows an example of a tile for an AWS S3 data source with the\n            name aws-s3 and the enpoint URL: NOTE A local-s3 MinIO\n              tile is also displayed.

Using Spark to Access S3 Object Storage Describes how to use Spark to access data in connected object storage. Spark can access object storage through the S3 proxy server or directly through the object\n        store endpoint, bypassing the proxy server. Spark needs a secret to securely pass configuration values. Use the S3 Proxy\n          Connection or Direct S3 Access method to create a secret and configure the\n        access information (access key and secret key). Then, update the Spark application YAML with\n        the secret and required connection properties. S3 Proxy Connection Run the following script in a notebook to generate the secret. You can also access a sample\n        script from your notebook server in the shared/ezua-tutorials/Data-Analytics/ directory. Example Script def deploy_s3_secret(namespace, spark_secret):\n    try:\n        #Run kubectl apply command using subprocess\n        subprocess.run(['kubectl', 'delete', 'secret', spark_secret, '-n', namespace], check=False)\n        subprocess.run(['kubectl', 'create', 'secret', 'generic', spark_secret, '-n', namespace , '--from-file=spark-defaults.conf'], check=True)\n        print(\"Secret creation successful!\")\n        except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:\n        print(f\"Secret creation  failed.

Provide the\n        object store access key and secret key as values for the spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.access.key and spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.secret.key properties in the file. Create a spark-defaults.conf file with the following\n            properties: spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.access.key EXAMPLE_ACCESS_KEY\nspark.hadoop.fs.s3a.secret.key EXAMPLE_SECRET_KEY Create a secret from the spark-defaults.conf file: kubectl create secret generic <k8s-secret-name> --from-file=spark-defaults.conf Connect the Spark Application to the Object Store Verify that the disable-chunk-encoding-334.jar file is in the shared/ezua-tutorials/Data-Analytics/Spark directory and then update the\n        Spark application YAML with the required connection properties, including the secret\n          name. IMPORTANT Regardless of how you generated the secret and whether you\n          used the S3 proxy or bypassed the proxy, you must complete the steps in this section to\n          connect the Spark application to the object store. If the disable-chunk-encoding-334.jar file is not in the shared/ezua-tutorials/Data-Analytics/Spark folder, navigate to the shared directory to get the file and then add it to shared/ezua-tutorials/Data-Analytics/Spark . Update the sparkConf section of the Spark application YAML to include\n            the following information: Secret Bucket name (name of the bucket in the S3 object store) Data source name Proxy endpoint URL For details, see Accessing Data in External S3 Object Stores .

Glossary Definitions for commonly used terms in HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics\n        environments. EzPresto Describes the EzPresto SQL query engine\n    and its featues. EzPresto in HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software EzPresto is an SQL query engine\n        based on the open-source, Linux foundation multi-parallel processing (MPP) query engine\n        PrestoDB, that is optimized to run federated queries across various data sources. Enterprise\n        BI applications such as Tableau, Power BI, and data processing engines, such as Spark, can\n        leverage EzPresto for rapid query performance\n        and prompt insights through federated data access. You can easily connect EzPresto to multiple\n        types of data sources from the Data Engineering space in HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software by going to Data Engineering > Data Sources . Connections require a JDBC\n        connection URL and user credentials. Data sets available to the connected user display in the Data Catalog, which is accessible\n        by going to Data Engineering > Data Catalog . In the Data Catalog, you\n        select the data sets you want to work with. You can query or cache the selected datasets. When you opt to cache data sets, you can modify the data sets prior to caching them. For\n        example, you can edit table and column names, remove columns, and create new schema. Cached\n        data sets (tables and views) are accessible in the Cached Assets space of HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software . You can access\n        cached assets by going to Data Engineering > Cached Assets . When you opt to query data sets, you can run federated queries (query across data sets in\n        multiple data sources) from the Query Editor. You can access the Query Editor by going to Data Engineering > Query Editor . Querying cached data sets\n        accelerates queries for significant performance gains. You can access the data in connected data sources from Superset and visualize the data that\n        results from complex, federated queries. Superset is accessible in HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software by going to BI Reporting > Dashboards or Applications &\n          Frameworks > Data Engineering tab and clicking Open in the Superset\n        tile. See Superset . You can also monitor the state of queries\n        and query details, including the query plan and resource usage, by going to Administration > EzSQL Cluster Monitoring . Refer to the following tutorials to get started with EzPresto in HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software : Data Source Connectivity and Exploration BI Reporting (Superset) Basics Retail Store Analysis Dashboard (Superset) EzPresto Key Features EzPresto provides the following key benefits\n        and features: Data Source Connectivity EzPresto includes connectors for\n              several data sources, including: HPE Ezmeral Data Fabric HDFS Data Lakes Hive Metastore (including managed HMS services such as AWS Glue) Object Stores Relational Databases NoSQL Databases Streaming data platforms Data warehouses Built-In Data Catalog The built-in data catalog provides dynamic registration of new data sources. Data\n              administrators can add new data sources as they become available without restarting\n              any services. When a data administrator adds a new data source, the data catalog\n              automatically refreshes so users, such as data analysts, can browse the new datasets\n              and perform upstream activities, such as reporting and dashboarding. Role-Based Access Controls Role-based access controls isolate queries such that members (non-admin users) can\n              only view and access their own queries. Admin users have full access to all queries.\n              For example, if a non-admin user runs a query that takes too long to complete or uses\n              too many resources, any admin in HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software can stop the query. Optimized Federated Queries Access data across disparate data sources in a single, optimized query. Query\n              optimizations for accelerated performance include: Predicate pushdown - EzPresto pushes filters in the WHERE clause down to the data source for processing to\n                  reduce the number of rows returned. Projection pushdown - EzPresto pushes projects (scanning of selected columns) down to the data source for\n                  processing to reduce the amount of data returned. Dynamic filtering - EzPresto evaluates predicates on the right side of a join and pushes them to the left side\n                  of the join to reduce the number of rows scanned from the left table. Cost-based optimization - EzPresto uses table statistics to calculate the cost (resource usage) of various query\n                  plans and chooses the optimal plan (plan that uses the least resources) to run the\n                  query. Distributed Caching EzPresto accelerates federated queries\n              through distributed caching of commonly used datasets. EzPresto currently supports explicit\n                caching where you manually modify tables and select the data that you want\n              cached for fast query access. You can use explicitly cached data for data modeling. EzPresto stores cached data in a data\n              fabric volume. The cache expires based on the set TTL (time-to-live). See Connect Data Sources and Cache Data . Explicit Caching You manually modify tables and select the data in the tables that you want\n                    stored in the cache for fast query access. You can use explicitly cached data\n                    for data modeling. You can set a TTL (time to live) for the cache. Self-Service Data Access End-users can browse data sets they have access to and select the relevant data for\n              their queries and analytical applications and workloads. Run-Anywhere Architecture EzPresto has a run-anywhere\n              architecture; you can run EzPresto on-premises, on edge, in the cloud, or hybrid environments. EzPresto Architecture The EzPresto architecture consists of the\n        following main components: Presto EzPresto uses a modified version of\n              Presto as the query engine. Most of the modifications are in the query planning and\n              optimizer areas, as well as support for different data sources, such as Teradata and\n              Snowflake, and in-process caching based on Apache Geode, tuned for OLTP and OLAP\n              access. The cache provides a tuple store with specialized columnar formats. WebService Provides the API. Web UI Provides the ability to access EzPresto in applications. Client Connections Provides the ability to connect to BI tools and external data sources via the JDBC\n              client.

Connect Data Sources Provides instructions for connecting HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software to external data sources. HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software includes\n      PrestoDB connectors for multiple types of data sources. Connecting to an external data source\n      is as simple as selecting the data source type and providing the required connection\n      parameters and credentials. Connecting data sources enables federated access to data for users\n      with the appropriate permissions. IMPORTANT Only HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software administrators can create data source connections. Each data source connection that you create must have a unique name. For example, you\n            can create multiple Hive data source connections, but each connection created must have\n            a different name. Access to data in a data source is based on the username and password supplied when\n            creating the data source connection. Data sources are accessible to all users with\n            permission once they are connected. Complete the following steps to connect a data source: Log in to HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software . Click Sign-in with SSO and enter your username and password. In the left navigation pane, select Data Engineering > Data Sources . Click Add New Data Source . Locate the tile with the type of data source that you want to connect, and click Create Connection . For example, if you want to connect to a Hive data source,\n          locate the Hive tile and click Create Connection in the Hive tile. In the drawer that opens, enter the connection parameters and then click Connect . TIP For every data source that you connect, you have the\n            option to select the following caching options: Enable Local Snapshot Table caches remote table data to accelerate\n                queries on the tables. The cache is active for the duration of the configured TTL\n                (time-to-live) or until the remote tables in the data source are altered.

Configuring a Hive Data Source with Kerberos Authentication Describes the required prerequisite steps to complete before you connect HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software to a Hive data source\n    that uses Kerberos authentication. You can connect HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software to a Hive data source that uses a Hive metastore and Kerberos for authentication. However,\n      before you create the connection, manually complete the following steps: Step 1 - Upload a krb5 configuration file to the shared location Step 2 - Configure EzPresto to use the krb5.conf file Step 3 - Connect HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software to the Hive data source Step 1 - Upload a krb5 configuration file to the shared location The krb5.conf file contains Kerberos configuration information, including\n        the locations of the KDCs and admin servers for the Kerberos realms used in the Hive\n        configuration. To upload the krb5.conf file to a shared location, complete\n        the following steps: Sign in to HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software . In the left navigation bar, go to Data Engineering > Data Sources > Data\n              Volumes. . Select the shared directory. Upload a krb5.conf file to the shared directory. TIP The\n              name of the file must be krb5.conf . Step 2 - Configure EzPresto to use the krb5.conf file In the left navigation bar, go to Tools & Frameworks > Data Engineering\n              > EzPresto .

Connect to CSV and Parquet Data in an External S3 Data Source via Hive Connector Describes how to use the Hive connector with Presto in HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software to connect to CSV and\n    Parquet data in S3-based external data sources. Connect to CSV and Parquet Data in an External S3 Data Source via Hive Connector You can connect HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software to any external S3-based data source through the Hive connector and Presto to access CSV and\n      Parquet data. For example, you can connect HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software to an external Data Fabric, Iceberg, or Spark cluster to access\n      CSV and Parquet data in S3 storage within these data sources. Connection Requirements Connecting to an S3-based external data source has the following requirements: You must have read/write access on the S3 data source. You must provide the required information to connect, including the: Access key Secret key S3 directory where files are stored S3 endpoint Connection fields vary depending on the type of data source you connect to (Data\n        Fabric, Iceberg, Spark, etc.); however, the S3-related fields (credentials, directory, and\n        endpoint) are always required regardless of the data source you are accessing S3 data\n          through. IMPORTANT A Hive Metastore is not required. HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software scans the files in\n          the S3 data source to get metadata and determine data types. For more information about the PrestoDB Hive connector, see Hive Connector . Connecting to an S3-Based Data Source To connect to an S3-based data source: Sign in to HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software .

Glossary Definitions for commonly used terms in HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics\n        environments. Cache Data Describes data caching and provides the steps for caching data in HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software . Caching data reduces latency. You can pre-load frequently accessed data into the cache to\n      improve the performance of queries on the data. Caching is useful when network latency is an\n      issue due to firewalls. When queries run against data or tables, the query engine automatically checks for cached\n      data and uses it if present. Cache optimization works when queries reference remote tables.\n      Queries issued against cached data do not require optimization. The cache lasts for the duration of the TTL (time-to-live). The user that connects HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software to a data source\n      selects the caching option ( Enable Local Snapshot Table ) and sets the TTL for the\n      cache. The default TTL is one day (set in minutes). HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software stores cached\n      data in an HPE Ezmeral Data Fabric volume. You can view and access cached data in the HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software UI by going to Data Engineering > Cached Assets in the left navigation bar. When you cache data, you can modify the data sets before caching them. The following list\n      describes some of the changes that you can make to a data set: Edit the data set name Remove columns from the data set Edit column names Change the schema or add a new schema Apply a schema to the selected data sets IMPORTANT Cached data is only available to the user that cached the data. Other users that sign\n            in to HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software cannot access the data that you cache. If data in the underlying data sources change, HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software does not automatically update the cache. You\n            must cache the data again to refresh the cache. How to Cache Data HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software must be\n        connected to the data sources with the data sets that you want to cache. See Connect Data Sources . To cache data, complete the following steps: Sign in to HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software . In the left navigation bar, select Data Engineering > Data\n              Catalog. In the Connected Data Sources area, select the data sources with the data that\n            you want to cache. The data sets available to you in the selected data sources displays\n            in the All Datasets area. Optionally, search or filter the data sets to find the data set(s) that you want to\n            cache. Click + Select for each of the data sets that you want to cache. Click Selected Datasets . The Selected Datasets drawer opens and displays\n            the selected data sets. Click Cache Datasets . The Manage Datasets screen appears. Each data set\n            that you selected appears on its own tab. Optionally, modify the data set(s). Use the pencil icon to modify data set and column names. Use the check boxes next to the column names to remove columns from the\n                data set. Use the Schema dropdown to change the schema or add a new schema. If you have selected multiple data sets, use the connector icon next to the\n                schema dropdown to apply the schema to all of the selected data sets. Click Cache Overview and compare the original data sets (Input Assets) to the\n            modified data sets (Output Assets) to verify the changes. If the changes to a data set are incorrect, click the pencil icon to edit the\n            data set. To cache the data set(s), click Save to cache . The system displays the\n            following message: Successfully initiating cache If an error\n            appears, correct the issue and continue. To view the cached data sets, go to Data Engineering > Cached Assets in the\n            left navigation bar of the HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software UI. NOTE Depending on the size of the data sets, it may take a\n              minute or so for them to appear as cached assets. Enable or Disable a Cache You can enable or\n        disable caching through the Enable Local Snapshot Table option when you create a data\n        source connection. See Connect Data Sources . You cannot disable caching\n      by setting the TTL to zero. If the TTL is set to zero, the cache expires immediately but still\n      consumes resources.

You can use Airflow to author, schedule, or monitor workflows and data pipelines. A workflow is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of tasks used to handle big data processing\n      pipelines. The workflows are started on a schedule or triggered by an event. DAGs define the\n      order to run tasks or rerun tasks in case of failures. The tasks define the actions to be\n      performed, such as ingest, monitor, report, and others. To learn more, see Airflow documentation . Airflow Functionality Airflow in HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software supports the following functionality: Extracting data from multiple data sources and running Spark jobs or other data\n            transformations.\u200b Training machine learning models.\u200b Automated generation of reports.\u200b Backups and other DevOps tasks.\u200b Airflow Architecture In HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software , Airflow\n        consists of the following parts: Airflow Operator Manages and maintains Airflow Base and Airflow Cluster Kubernetes Custom Resources\n                by creating and updating Kubernetes objects. Airflow Base Manages the PostgreSQL database that stores Airflow metadata. Airflow Cluster Deploys the UI and scheduler components of Airflow. In HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software , there is\n        only one instance of Airflow per cluster and Airflow DAGs are accessed by all authenticated\n        users. Airflow Components Airflow consists of the following components: Scheduler Triggers the scheduled workflows and submits the tasks to an executor to run. Executor Executes the tasks or delegates the tasks to workers for execution. Worker Executes the tasks. Web Server Provides a user interface to analyze, schedule, monitor, and visualize the tasks and\n              DAG. The Web Server enables you to manage users, roles, and set configuration\n              options. DAG Directory Contains DAG files read by Scheduler, Executor, and Web Server. Metadata Database Stores the metadata about DAGs\u2019 state, runs, and Airflow configuration options. Airflow Limitations Airflow in HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software has the following limitations: The CPU and memory resource limits for executors cannot be modified (CPU: 1, memory:\n            2Gi). To use the Spark Operator, you must provide the username by specifying it under the\n            \"username\" key in the DAG Run Configuration. The logs of successfully run DAGs are available until the corresponding pods are\n            deleted. To learn more about Airflow, see Airflow Concepts .

Glossary Definitions for commonly used terms in HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics\n        environments. Airflow DAGs Git Repository Describes how HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software reads DAGs and how to configure a GitHub repository in\n    Airflow. Airflow DAGs are pulled from the GitHub repository that you specify when you configure\n      Airflow. HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software supports both private and public GitHub repositories. HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software can only read DAGs from a GitHub repository on a\n      specified branch from a specified subdirectory. If the GitHub repository is located behind a\n      proxy, you can configure a proxy for the GitHub repository in Airflow. In an air-gapped environment where there is no pre-configured proxy to forward outgoing\n      cluster connections to the internet, the installation of Airflow will not function properly.\n      To resolve this issue, the administrator of the HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software must either manually set up an HTTP proxy or configure\n      Airflow with an internal Git repository. IMPORTANT Best practice is to use Git\n        submodules if multiple users have DAGs in their own repositories. To manage multiple users\n        within the same GitHub repository, the HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software platform administrator can create a root GitHub repository and\n        then add all user GitHub repositories as submodules. As owner of the root GitHub repository,\n        the platform administrator can update the Git submodules after users add/remove/modify\n        files. For example, when a user modifies files, the user can ask the platform administrator\n        to update the latest commit hash of the user's Git submodule in the root repository.

Submitting Spark Applications by Using DAGs Describes how to submit the Spark applications by using DAGs in Airflow. Prerequisites Prepare the DAG for your Spark application. Add your DAG to the Git repository. NOTE If you do not have the repository to store\n            Airflow DAGs, request an administrator to configure the Git repository now. For details,\n            see Airflow DAGs Git Repository . After your DAG is available in the Git repository, sign in to HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software as a member. About this task To run the DAG to submit the Spark applications in Airflow, follow these steps: Navigate to the Airflow screen using either of the following methods: Click Data Engineering > Airflow Pipelines . Click Applications & Frameworks , select the Data Engineering tab, and click Open in the Airflow tile. In Airflow , verify that you are on the DAGs screen. Click <your-spark-application> DAG. For example: Click Code to view the DAG code. Click Graph to view the graphical representation of the DAG. Click Run (play button) and select Trigger DAG w/ config to specify the\n            custom configuration. To run a DAG after making configuration changes, click Trigger. To view details for the DAG, click Details . Under DAG Details , you can see green, red, and/or yellow buttons with\n            the number of times the DAG ran successfully or failed. Click the Success button. To find your job, sort by End Date to see the latest jobs that have run, and\n            then scroll to the right and click the log icon under Log URL for that run. Note that\n            jobs run with the\n              configuration: Conf \"username\":\"your_username\" When running Spark applications using Airflow,\n              you can see the logs. IMPORTANT The cluster clears the logs that result\n                from the DAG runs. The duration after which the cluster clears the logs depends on\n                the Airflow task, cluster configuration, and policy. Results Once you have triggered the DAG, you can view the Spark application in the Spark\n          Applications screen. To view the Spark application, go to Analytics > Spark\n        Applications . Alternatively, you can go to Applications & Frameworks and then\n        click on the Analytics tab. On the Analytics tab, select the Spark tile and click Open .

Glossary Definitions for commonly used terms in HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics\n        environments. Defining RBACs on DAGs Describes role-based access controls (RBACs) with respect to Airflow in HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software and how to define RBACs\n    to permit access to DAGs. Role-based access controls (RBACs) are an authorization system based on policies, user roles,\n      and bindings between the roles and policies that protect resources. With the introduction of\n      RBACs, HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software users\n      (admins and members) can grant users access to their DAGs through access controls that they\n      define in the DAG constructors. Admin Role The following list describes DAG access for admins and the admin-related tasks that\n            impact user access to DAGs: HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software admins have full access to all Airflow DAGs regardless of the access controls set. Admins can assign a member the admin role in HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software to give the\n                user full access to DAGs; however, this action must occur before the user signs in\n                to the HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software UI and accesses Airflow. See User Roles . If an admin removes a user from HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software , that user's access to Airflow is automatically\n                revoked. Other users can no longer access the DAGs that the removed user\n                  shared. CAUTION HPE only supports user role changes made through the HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software UI. Role changes made in HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software are automatically propagated to Airflow. HPE does not\n                  support role changes made directly in Airflow because the changes do not propagate\n                  back to HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software , which can cause unexpected system behaviors. TIP Best practice is to use Git submodules if multiple users have DAGs in\n                  their own repositories. To manage multiple users within the same GitHub\n                  repository, the HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software platform administrator can create a root GitHub repository\n                  and then add all user GitHub repositories as submodules. As owner of the root\n                  GitHub repository, the platform administrator can update the Git submodules after\n                  users add, remove, or modify files. For example, when a user modifies files, the\n                  user can ask the platform administrator to update the latest commit hash of the\n                  user's Git submodule in the root repository. For additional information, refer to GitHub - About code owners and Working with submodules . Member Role The following list describes DAG access for members: Members can access DAGs: When DAGs do not have any access controls defined. When permitted to do so through access controls (either defined on their\n                    username or defined through the All user role). Members can define access controls on the DAGs they create. Supported Access Controls The following table lists and describes the access controls that admins and users can\n        define in the DAG constructor, as well as the associated access control values to use when\n        configuring the access controls on a user in the DAG constructor. Access Control Type Access Control Value Description Read can_read The specified user can see the source code but cannot launch the DAG. Edit can_edit The specified user can launch the DAG and add some notes. Delete can_delete The specified user can delete the DAG; however, DAGs repopulate in the GitHub\n                  repository every few seconds. Define the access controls on a username through the access_control parameter in the DAG constructor, as shown in the following example for user01 : access_control={\n\t\t'role_user01': {\n\t\t\t'can_read',\n\t\t\t'can_edit',\n\t\t\t'can_delete'\n\t\t}\n\t} If you want to grant all users access to a DAG, define access\n        controls on All instead of a specific username, as shown in the following\n        example: access_control={\n\t\t'All': {\n\t\t\t'can_read',\n\t\t\t'can_edit',\n\t\t\t'can_delete'\n\t\t}\n\t} Defining RBACs on Users You can define access controls on a user (username) that exists or does not yet exist in HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software . Adding a\n        user to HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software after\n        you define roles on the user (username) in the DAG constructor will not cause any issues\n        between the systems. An HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software admin can add or create the user. See Adding and Removing Users . IMPORTANT The DAG must exist in the GitHub repository or a Git submodule that\n          the Airflow instance in HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software points to. To define access controls on a user in the DAG constructor: Go to the GitHub repository and add the following access_control parameters and values to the DAG constructor, as shown in the following\n              example: }\nwith DAG{\n\tdag_id='example_kubernetes_operator',\n\tdafault_args=default_args,\n\tschedule_interval=None,\n\ttags=['example'], access_control={\n\t\t'role_<username>': {\n\t\t\t'can_read',\n\t\t\t'can_edit',\n\t\t\t'can_delete'\n\t\t}\n\t} } as dag: TIP If you commit a DAG without the access_control annotation, all\n                  users (admins and members) can view and access the DAG. Only include the access role(s) that you want the user to have. For example, if\n                  you do not want the user to launch the DAG, do not assign the user the can_edit access control. Commit and push the changes to the DAG. Viewing Access Controls on Users HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software admins can go\n        to the Security page in Airflow to view access controls on users. Members cannot\n        access the Security page. To view access controls on users: Sign in to HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software . In the left navigation bar, select Tools and Frameworks .

Prerequisites Sign in to HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software as a\n            member. About this task In HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software , whylogs is integrated to work with\n                Airflow DAGs. You can use whylogs with Airflow to profile and monitor the data and\n                detect drifts as data flows through the data pipelines. To use whylogs with Airflow DAGs, refer to Airflow DAG example in GitHub.\n                The basic steps are outlined as follows: Import the required libraries and modules from whylogs in your Airflow DAG\n                        script. You can use notebooks to create your Airflow DAG. To learn about\n                        notebooks, see Creating and Managing Notebook Servers . Define your Airflow DAG that can profile and monitor the data to detect\n                        drifts. Add your DAG to the Git repository. NOTE If you do not have the repository\n                            to store Airflow DAGs, request an administrator to configure the Git\n                            repository now. For details, see Airflow DAGs Git Repository . Navigate to the Airflow screen using either of the\n                        following methods: Click Data Engineering > Airflow\n                                Pipelines .

Superset is a cloud-native business intelligence web application that collects and processes\n      large volumes of data that can be used in the data visualizations and dashboards that you\n      create within it. Superset is accessible in HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software by going to BI Reporting > Dashboards or Applications & Frameworks > Data Engineering in the left\n      navigation panel. When you connect HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software to various data sources, you can access the data in those data sources\n      from Superset. For example, you can create any type of chart in Superset and specify query\n      conditions on a selected data set to visualize the query results in the chart. Superset works\n      with EzPresto , the HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software accelerated SQL query engine, to process the query and display results\n      in the chart. You can then add the chart to a dashboard and continue this process to build out\n      a dashboard that visualizes your analytical workloads. Underlying Superset and EzPresto is a Presto\n      database that unifies the data sources connected to HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software . The unified data source connection enables you to: Add the data sets you create in the HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software Data Engineering space to Superset. Connect Superset directly to the Presto database for direct access to the unified data\n          sources. You can also connect Superset to external databases (those that are not part of the unified\n      data source connection in HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software ).

Defining RBACs in Superset Describes role-based access controls (RBACs) with respect to Superset in HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software and how to define RBACs\n    to permit access to Superset dashboards. Role-based access controls (RBACs) are an authorization system based on policies, user roles,\n      and bindings between the roles and policies that protect resources. With the introduction of\n      RBAC, HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software maps the HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software admin and\n      member roles to Superset Admin and AlphaDbAccess roles respectively. The following user role mapping is defined in the Superset HELM chart (YAML file): User Type Mapping Parameter Admin AUH_ROLE_ADMIN = 'Admin' Member AUTH_USER_REGISTRATION_ROLE = \"AlphaDbAccess\" TIP You cannot edit the role mappings in the HELM chart. Admin Role (Admin) The following list describes admin access and the admin-related tasks that impact\n            users in Superset: Admins can edit (add or remove) roles in the Superset UI. Admins can change a member's role in HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software to admin . Admins can view all user activity and data, including all dashboards created by\n                all users, as well as all of the data in the dashboards. Admins can access the security settings in Superset, such as viewing user\n                profiles, including user roles and access controls. Admins can edit a user in Superset and change the user's roles. Member Role (AlphaDbAccess) The following list describes Superset access for members (AlphaDbAccess): Members can create their own database connections in Superset. Members can view charts and datasets created by other users, but cannot view\n                dashboards unless explicitly permitted to do so. Members can access dashboards they create and dashboards that other users have\n                shared with them. NOTE Access to a dashboard does not grant access to data. The user\n                  must have permission on the data itself to view the data in a dashboard.

Using Your Own Open-Source Spark Images Describes how to use your own open-source Spark images to submit Spark\n    applications. Your own open-source Spark images compatible with the Kubernetes version supported on HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software . With the\n      support of bringing your own open-source Spark, you can build Spark with any profile of your\n      choice; however, there will be no support for Data Fabric filesystem, Data Fabric Streams, and\n      any other Data Fabric sources and sinks that require a Data Fabric client. These Spark images\n      will not support Data Fabric-specific security features (data-fabric SASL\n        ( maprsasl )). To use your own open-source Spark images, follow the next steps: Build Spark. See Building Spark . Build Spark images to run in HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software . See Building Images . Choose one of the following: Using the Create Spark Application GUI Using Airflow Using the Create Spark Application GUI To use your own open-source Spark images, choose one of the following option in the GUI: Using Upload YAML Configure your Spark YAML file with the built Spark image of your\n                    choice. image: <base-repository>/<image-name>:<image-tag> To set the logged-in user\u2019s context, add the following configuration in the sparkConf section. spark.hpe.webhook.security.context.autoconfigure: \"true\" To\n                    learn more about user context, see Setting the User Context .

Setting the User Context Describes how to set the user context when using the\n    Spark OSS\n    images. User context is not configured automatically for the\n      Spark OSS\n      images. If you do not set the user context, the user identity that is set in the image is used to\n      access the data sources like persistent volumes. This can cause your Spark application to fail\n      due to a lack of proper permissions. To set the logged-in user\u2019s context when using the\n      Spark OSS\n      images, add the following configuration in the sparkConf section of your Spark application YAML\n      file. spark.hpe.webhook.security.context.autoconfigure: \"true\" Once you add this configuration to the YAML file, HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software automatically defines and sets the user context for the logged-in user, and your Spark\n      application runs successfully. NOTE Do not add this configuration to your Spark application YAML file if you are using the\n        default Spark images that support Data Fabric services.

Using Spark SQL API Describes how to use Spark SQL API in HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software . In HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software , you can use the Spark SQL API in two different\n      ways: External Metastore NOTE There will be some limitations to integration with external metastore. To integrate Spark with external metastore, follow these steps: Set the metastore URI with the spark.hive.metastore.uris config option.\n          This URI should be public and accessible from your Spark applications. Set the value of spark.sql.warehouse.dir property to the same value as\n          that of external metastore. For example: if you want to query a managed table then the\n          path to that managed table must match in both metastore and Spark runtime. Verify that the metastore host can accept external connections so that Spark can connect\n          to the metastore. Configure the gateway rules for securing the metastore as the metastore\n          doesn\u2019t have authentication and authorization. Verify that your Spark applications are querying the data from locations accessible\n          within the Spark runtime. Temporary Views The temporary view is a feature in the Spark DataFrame API. You can read data and create a\n        temporary view for the data by using the temporary view feature. These views are not global\n        and cannot be shared between any two Spark applications. You can use a temporary view in the\n        following two scenarios: If the schema is available for your data, use DataFrame:create[OrReplace]TempView . Some file formats already include\n          schema, for example, parquet files or CSV files with the header. You can read the file,\n          create a DataFrame and then call the create[OrReplace]TempView function\n          and give it the view name and finally, you can query data using Spark SQL API. If the schema is not available for your data, you can set it while creating or\n          converting the DataFrame, then create the temporary view. By default, Spark sets aliases\n          for the column names like underscore 1, underscore 2, and so on, however, you can set your\n          own column names.

To enable the RAPIDS plugin and allocate the GPU resources, add: # Enabling RAPIDs plugin\nspark.plugins: \"com.nvidia.spark.SQLPlugin\"\nspark.rapids.sql.enabled: \"true\"\nspark.rapids.force.caller.classloader: \"false\"\n \n# GPU allocation and discovery settings\nspark.task.resource.gpu.amount: \"1\"\nspark.executor.resource.gpu.amount: \"1\"\nspark.executor.resource.gpu.vendor: \"nvidia.com\" To set the path to the GPU discovery script,\n                add: spark.executor.resource.gpu.discoveryScript: \"/opt/mapr/spark/spark-<spark-version>/examples/src/main/scripts/getGpusResources.sh\" To set the RAPIDS shim layer used for the run,\n                add: spark.rapids.shims-provider-override: \"com.nvidia.spark.rapids.shims.<spark-identifier>.SparkShimServiceProvider\" The\n                Spark version distributed by Hewlett Packard Enterprise is\n                compatible with its corresponding open-source version. The RAPIDS jar includes the\n                shim layer provider classes called com.nvidia.spark.rapids.shims.[spark-identifier].SparkShimServiceProvider .\n                You can replace the [spark-identifier] based on the Spark\n                distributed by Hewlett Packard Enterprise such as: For spark-3.5.0, the identifier is spark350. For example, for spark-gpu-3.4.0, set the RAPIDS shim layer as\n                    follows: spark.rapids.shims-provider-override: \"com.nvidia.spark.rapids.shims.spark340.SparkShimServiceProvider\" Verifying Spark Applications are Running on GPU To verify the Spark applications are running on GPU, you can use the explain Spark\n        method. Run the following PySpark application: from pyspark.sql import SQLContext\nfrom pyspark import SparkConf\nfrom pyspark import SparkContext\n \nconf = SparkConf()\nsc = SparkContext.getOrCreate()\nsqlContext = SQLContext(sc)\n \ndf = sqlContext.createDataFrame([1,2,3], \"int\").toDF(\"value\")\ndf.createOrReplaceTempView(\"df\")\n \nsqlContext.sql(\"SELECT * FROM df WHERE value<>1\").explain()\nsqlContext.sql(\"SELECT * FROM df WHERE value<>1\").show()\n \nsc.stop() If you get the following output where the explain method prints the GPU-related stages, you\n        can verify that your Spark application is running on GPU. == Physical Plan ==\nGpuColumnarToRow false\n+- GpuFilter NOT (value#2 = 1), true\n   +- GpuRowToColumnar targetsize(2147483647)\n      +- *(1) SerializeFromObject [input[0, int, false] AS value#2]\n         +- Scan[obj#1] However, if you get the following output, your Spark application is not running on GPU but\n        instead on CPU.

Running Spark Applications in Namespaces Describes how namespaces work with regard to Spark applications in HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software . Information in this topic relates to Spark applications that use the HPE-curated Spark images or Spark OSS images with the security context set\n        in the Spark application YAML, as described in Setting Security Context for Spark OSS Images . HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software users (admins\n        and members) can submit Spark applications through the following clients and interfaces: HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software UI APIs/CLI (kubectl) Notebooks Airflow DAGs By default, when a user submits a Spark application, the Spark application runs in the\n        user's designated namespace, isolating the user's work and resource use from other users in\n        the HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software cluster.\n        For example, if user01 is signed into HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software and submits a Spark application, the Spark\n        application automatically runs in the user01 namespace. Only user01 can access the Spark application and Spark application details in\n        the Spark History Server UI. Alternatively, a user can run their Spark applications in the spark namespace. When a user changes the namespace to spark in the Spark\n        application YAML, the Spark application runs in the spark namespace and all\n        users (admins and members) can access the Spark application through the HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software UI. However, only the\n        user that submitted the Spark application can access the application details in the Spark History Server UI . NOTE Currently,\n          the HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software UI does\n          not support running Spark applications in the spark namespace. You can\n          only run Spark applications in the spark namespace through kubectl,\n          notebooks, and Airflow DAGs. The following table describes how HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software responds when you submit Spark applications through the supported\n        clients and interfaces: Client/Interface Description HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software UI Spark applications run in the user's designated namespace. Does not support running Spark applications in the spark namespace. If a user changes the namespace in their Spark application, the system\n                      automatically reverts the namespace back to the namespace of the user\n                      submitting the Spark application. For example, if user01 submits the Spark application as user02, the system\n                      automatically reverts the namespace back to user01 and runs\n                      the application in the user01 namespace. API/CLI (kubectl) Spark applications run in the user's designated namespace. Users can change the namespace to spark ; Spark applications\n                      run in the spark namespace and become accessible to all\n                      users. If a user changes the namespace in their Spark application, for example user01 changes the namespace to user02, the system accepts the Spark application, but returns an access denied error. Notebook Spark applications run in the user's designated namespace. If a user changes the namespace in their Spark application, for example user01 changes the namespace to user02, the system returns an access denied error. Airflow DAG A Spark application launched through an Airflow DAG automatically runs in\n                      the namespace of the user that deployed the DAG. For example, if user01 deploys a DAG with a Spark application in the\n                      workflow, the Spark application runs in the user01 namespace. Manually triggered DAGs launch in the namespace of the trigger event owner. Scheduled DAGs launch in the namespace of the last user to un-pause the\n                      DAG. Spark History Server In an HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software cluster, one Spark History Server runs in the spark namespace. Users can go\n        to the Spark History Server UI to view a list of all Spark applications that have run.\n        However, users can only view the details of Spark applications that they submit, regardless\n        of the namespace they use (their own namespace or the spark namespace). If a user submits a Spark application in the spark namespace, only that\n        user can view the application details in the Spark History Server UI. For example, if user01 submits a spark application in the spark namespace, user02 cannot access the Spark application details in the Spark\n        History Server UI. Only user01 can view the Spark application details. The system returns an unauthorized message when users try to view application details for\n        Spark applications that were submitted by other users. Setting Security Context for Spark OSS\n        Images The Spark OSS images do not contain the security context required to run\n        Spark applications against volumes in HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software . HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software denies user access to the volume if it cannot authenticate the user,\n        which results in Spark application failures. To add security context to your Spark\n      application, add the following configuration setting in the Spark application\n        YAML: sparkConf:\n    spark.hpe.webhook.security.context.autoconfigure: \"true\" This security context flag sets the pod security context and enables HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software to recognize you as a\n        valid HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software user\n        when you run your Spark applications. When you add the security context flag to the\n        Spark application YAML and run the Spark application, the application automatically runs in\n        your user-designated namespace. If you change the namespace to spark , the\n        Spark application runs in the spark namespace. WARNING Do not\n          set the security context in HPE-Curated Spark images. Setting the security context in\n          HPE-Curated Spark images causes Spark applications to fail. For additional\n        information, see User Isolation and Setting the User Context .

Using whylogs with Spark Describes how to use whylogs with Spark. Prerequisites Sign in to HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software as a\n            member. About this task In HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software , whylogs is integrated to work with Livy\n                sessions submitted through Kubeflow notebooks using the %manage_spark magic function. You can use whylogs with Spark to\n                profile, visualize, and monitor the data and detect. To use whylogs with Spark, refer to Data Validation example and WhyLogs Profiling example in GitHub. The basic steps are outlined as\n                    follows: Create a notebook or import your notebook into HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software . See Creating and Managing Notebook Servers . Enter the %manage_spark command in your notebook and\n                        configure your Spark session through different tabs. You must select the\n                        authentication as Single Sign-On and the runtime language as Python. To\n                        learn about creating sessions by using %manage_spark , see %manage_spark . Enter the %config_spark magic in your notebook and update\n                        the value of spark.kubernetes.container.image property to gcr.io/mapr-252711/spark-3.5.0:202401221805R .\n                        Click Submit when done. To learn about using %config_spark , see %config_spark . Verify that your created session is in the Idle state. You can verify by clicking the Manage Sessions tab or by navigating to the Spark Interactive\n                            Sessions screen. See Managing Interactive Sessions . Once the session is in the Idle state, you can set\n                        the environment variables and import the required libraries and modules from\n                        whylogs. Create data frames to profile the data or validate the data with whylogs and\n                        run the notebook. Once you finish running your notebook, navigate back to the HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software home screen. In the left navigation bar, go to Data Engineering > Data\n                            Sources . Click Browse .

Defining RBACs on MLflow Experiments Describes role-based access controls (RBACs) with respect to MLflow in HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software and how to define RBACs\n    to permit access to experiments in MLflow. Role-based access controls (RBACs) are an authorization system based on policies, user roles,\n      and bindings between the roles and policies that protect resources. With the introduction of\n      RBACs, HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software users\n      (admins and members) can define access controls on their experiments through the MLflow API or\n      SDK. User access to MLflow is granted when a user makes a request to the MLflow server. A user is\n      automatically authenticated and granted access to MLflow based on their user role in HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software , as either an admin or\n      a member. Admins can add users through the HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software UI, as described in Adding and Removing Users and User Roles . Admin Role The following list describes admin access and the admin-related tasks that\n      impact users in MLflow: Admins can view and edit all experiments in MLflow regardless of the access controls\n          set. For example, if the NO_PERMISSIONS access control is defined in an\n          experiment, admins can still access the experiment. Admins can change a user's role in HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software to admin . When a user has the admin role in HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software , that user\n          can access all existing experiments in MLflow. If the admin role is removed from\n          the user (reverted back to member ), the user cannot see any experiments created by\n          other users. NOTE By default, the MLflow default admin user is disabled to prevent any\n            security issues, such as the plain text password being stored in open-source\n            code. Member Role The following list describes MLflow access for members : By default, members have full control over the experiments they create. When a member\n          creates an experiment, the experiment has the MANAGE permission set. The MANAGE permission enables the experiment owner to grant other users\n          access to their experiment through access controls. Members cannot access experiments created by other users unless explicitly permitted to\n          do so by the experiment owner through access controls set in the expermiment. If an HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software admin changes a member's role to admin in the HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software UI, the user is granted full access to all\n          experiments in MLflow. CAUTION HPE only supports user role changes made through the HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software UI. Role changes made\n        in HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software are\n        automatically propagated to MLflow. HPE does not support role changes made directly in\n        MLflow because the changes do not propagate back to HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software , which can cause unexpected system behaviors. Supported Access Controls HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software supports the\n        following access controls on experiments: Access Control Type Access Control Value Description None NO_PERMISSIONS Only the experiment creator and admins can access the experiment. Returns an\n                  \"access denied\" message when unauthorized users try to access the\n                  experiment. Manage MANAGE Default permission set on an experiment at the time of creation. Only the\n                  experiment creator and admins can access the experiment. You cannot set this\n                  access control on any existing experiments. Read READ The experiment creator has full access to the experiment. Specified users can\n                  only view the experiment in MLflow. Modify EDIT Experiment creator has full access to the experiment. Specified users modify\n                  the experiment in MLflow. Delete DELETE Only admin users can use DELETE to remove permissions on an\n                  experiment. Defining Access Controls on Users To permit access to experiments, use the MLflow API or SDK in your MLflow experiments to\n        define access controls on users. MLflow provides an AuthServiceClient that implements CRUD functionality\n        for experiment_permission and model_permission objects. Use the following code examples as a guide to define access controls on users. Required code to set access controls on an experiment from mlflow.server.auth.client import AuthServiceClient\nuser = \"<username>\"\npermission = \"<access_control>\"\nexp_id = mlflow.get_experiment_by_name(experiment_name).experiment_id\nclient = AuthServiceClient(\"http://mlflow.mlflow.svc.cluster.local:5000\") Create permission permission = \"READ\"\nexp_permission = client.create_experiment_permission(exp_id, user, permission) Modify permission permission = \"EDIT\"\nexp_permission = client.update_experiment_permission(exp_id, user, permission)\n\npermission = \"NO_PERMISSIONS\"\nexp_permission = client.update_experiment_permission(exp_id, user, permission) Delete permission exp_permission = client.delete_experiment_permission(exp_id, user, permission)\nclient.get_user( 'admin' ) On this page Supported Access Controls Defining Access Controls on Users Partners Support Dev-Hub Community Training ALA Privacy Policy Glossary Search Search current doc version",

Resource Configuration In HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software , a Ray\n        cluster is deployed using KubeRay Operator. Currently, the Ray cluster consists of a single head node and a single worker node.\n        Auto-scaling is enabled by default for worker nodes, the Ray cluster automatically scales up\n        and down based on resource demand. When there is no workload, the Ray cluster has a head, and a worker node as\n        follows: > kubectl -n kuberay get pod\nNAME                                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\nkuberay-operator-6c75647d8b-7mpqp             1/1     Running   0          22h\nray-cluster-kuberay-head-gw8lc                2/2     Running   0          22h When a submitted job demands more resources than the cluster current resources, then the\n        auto scaler will create two more pods as follows: Auto-scaling is enabled by default configuration so that the Ray cluster creates two more\n        worker pods when needed. If a pod stays idle for 60 seconds, then the auto scaler destroys\n        it. Upper resource limits for pods type are as follows: Head pod: 2 CPU and 8 GB memory. Worker pod: 3 CPU and 8 GB memory. Resource Management While running a heavy workload, you might get an Out of Memory exception. To avoid the\n        out-of-memory exception, there are two best practices: Memory Aware Scheduling By default, Ray does not consider the potential memory usage of a task or an actor\n                when scheduling as it cannot estimate beforehand how much memory is required by the\n                task or actor. However, if you know how much memory a task or an actor might\n                require, you can specify it in the resource requirements of ray.remote decorator to enable memory-aware scheduling. For example: # reserve 500MiB of available memory to place this task \n@ray.remote(memory=500 * 1024 * 1024) \ndef some_function(x): \n  pass # reserve 2.5GiB of available memory to place this actor\n\n@ray.remote(memory=2500 * 1024 * 1024) \nclass SomeActor(object): \n   def __init__(self, a, b): \n    pass Scheduling Strategies There are two scheduling strategies in Ray: Default Ray uses DEFAULT as the default strategy. Currently, Ray\n                        assigns tasks or actors on nodes until the resource utilization is beyond a\n                        certain threshold and spreads them afterward. For example: @ray.remote \ndef func(): \n  return 1 Spread Ray uses SPREAD strategy to spread tasks or actors among\n                        available nodes. For example: @ray.remote(scheduling_strategy=\"SPREAD\") \ndef spread_func(): \n  return 2 To learn more see Scheduling Strategies .

GPU Support for Ray Describes how to enable GPU, configure the GPU resources, and disable GPU for\n    Ray. Sign in as Administrator to HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software to enable GPU to submit\n      GPU-accelerated jobs with Ray. You can enable GPU support for Ray in two different ways: Enabling GPU support during HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software installation. Enabling GPU support after HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software installation. Enabling GPU Support During HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software Installation To enable the GPU for Ray during the HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software installation,\n        see GPU Support . If you enabled GPU during the platform installation, you do not need to separately enable\n        GPU for Ray. The platform installation automatically enables GPU for all applications and\n        frameworks including Ray. Enabling GPU Support and Configuring Resources After HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software Installation Before enabling the GPU support, when Ray is in an idle state, there are the following\n        three pods running: > kubectl -n kuberay get pod\nNAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\nkuberay-head-5c2jj                  2/2     Running   0          10m\nkuberay-operator-7b976fdb86-x5k4c   1/1     Running   0          10m\nkuberay-worker-smallgroup-xhhbq     1/1     Running   0          10m The operator pod creates the head pod and monitors the cluster. The head pod is the cluster\n        master and generates additional small worker pods as required. To enable GPU support for Ray after HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software installation,\n        follow these steps: Click the Applications & Frameworks icon on the left\n          navigation bar. Navigate to the Ray tile under the Data\n            Science tab. Click the three dots menu on the Ray tile and click Configure . Set the value of gpu.enabled to true . (Optional) Modify the available resources as required by updating the values within the resources_gpu section. NOTE With MIG configuration, only one GPU can be assigned per application. To learn\n              more on what happens when you assign more than one GPU to the Ray cluster, see GPU . For details regarding GPU, see GPU Support . Click Configure . Results: The GPU is now enabled on Ray. After enabling GPU, Ray creates more pods as\n        follows: > kubectl -n kuberay get pod\nNAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\nkuberay-head-5c2jj                  2/2     Running   0          10m\nkuberay-operator-7b976fdb86-x5k4c   1/1     Running   0          10m\nkuberay-worker-smallgroup-xhhbq     1/1     Running   0          10m kuberay-worker-workergroup-rdptj    1/1     Running   0          13s #New pod with GPU resources! You\n        can also see the new pod with GPU resources on Ray Dashboard. Unlike the worker-smallgroup pod, the worker-workergroup pod cannot be scaled using an autoscaler. When GPU-accelerated jobs are submitted, the worker-workergroup pod handles the workload. Simultaneously, Ray manages\n        regular jobs by using the worker-smallgroup pod. Submitting GPU-Accelerated Jobs to Ray Cluster To submit the GPU-accelerated jobs, specify the following resource\n        requirements: @ray.remote(num_gpus=1)\ndef use_gpu():\n    print(\"ray.get_gpu_ids(): {}\".format(ray.get_gpu_ids()))\n    print(\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES: {}\".format(os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"])) The function use_gpu does not use any GPUs directly. Instead, Ray\n        schedules it on a node with at least one GPU and allocates one GPU specifically for its run.\n        However, it is up to the function to utilize the GPU, which is typically done through an\n        external library such as TensorFlow. Ray example using GPUs: For this example to work, ensure you have installed GPU version of\n        TensorFlow. @ray.remote(num_gpus=1)\ndef use_gpu():\n    import tensorflow as tf\n \n    # Create a TensorFlow session. TensorFlow will restrict itself to use the\n    # GPUs specified by the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable.\n    tf.Session() NOTE As Ray does not have the GPU-specific API, you must properly configure Ray jobs to run\n          on GPU. Without proper configuration, Ray jobs will run on CPUs. To learn more, see Using Ray with GPUs . Disabling GPU Support for Ray To disable GPU support for Ray after HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software installation,\n        follow these steps: Click the Applications & Frameworks icon on the left\n            navigation bar. Navigate to the Ray tile under the Data Science tab. Click the three dots menu on the Ray tile and click Configure . Set the value of gpu.enabled to false . Click Configure .

Stabilize the Head Pod In the Ray cluster, a head pod has a key role and therefore it should be stable. Hewlett Packard Enterprise recommends not scheduling any workload\n              on the head pod. The worker nodes handle all workloads in the default deployment of HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software . To make the head pod stable, when creating the Ray cluster, set {\"num-cpus\": \"0\"} in \"rayStartParams\" of \"headGroupSpec\" such that the Ray scheduler skips the head node\n              when scheduling workloads.

Installing Custom Packages in Kubeflow Notebooks at Runtime Describes how to install custom packages in existing Kubeflow notebooks that persist\n    between restarts. You can only install custom packages in a Kubeflow notebook in connected HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software environments only for two types of packages \u2013 conda packages and pip packages. You cannot install custom packages in air-gapped environments. Packages installed to the base\n      environment do not persist; the packages are removed after the notebook restarts. By default, the base conda environment is activated for all notebook users. All notebook\n      users can perform the following tasks: Install packages to the base environment Create and install your own conda environment Use the conda environment of another notebook user, if permitted by the environment\n          owner You can install packages that persist (save between restarts). You can also install packages\n      that do not persist (do not save between restarts). If packages do not have to persist between restarts, install the packages to the\n          base conda environment. This applies to both single-user and multi-user modes. If packages must persist between restarts, create an individual conda\n          environment. This applies to both single-user and multi-user modes. The following sections describe how to create an individual conda environment where you can\n      install packages that persist between restarts in single and multi-user modes: NOTE Run\n        commands in the notebook terminal. Single-User Mode Complete the following steps in the notebook if you want to install custom packages that\n        persist between restarts in single-user mode: Create an individual conda\n            environment: conda create --prefix ~/.conda/envs/kf-users-env --clone base Activate the conda environment: conda activate kf-users-env Multi-User Mode Any user with access to the notebook, typically the owner, can create the conda\n        environment. The conda environment is shared with other users (between contributors). All\n        users get equivalent permissions. Users can use the existing packages, as well as install\n        and remove the packages. Complete the following steps in the notebook if you want to install custom packages that\n        persist between restarts in multi-user mode: Create the conda\n            environment: umask 0000 && conda create --prefix ~/.conda/envs/kf-users-env --clone base Activate the conda environment: conda activate kf-users-env Add users (contributors) to the conda\n            environment: conda config --append envs_dirs  /home/<notebook_owner_username>/.conda/envs Activate the conda environment for\n            users: conda activate kf-users-env Install the conda\n            package: conda install package-name=<version> Install the PIP\n            package: pip install package-name==<version> On this page Single-User Mode Multi-User Mode Partners Support Dev-Hub Community Training ALA Privacy Policy Glossary Search Search current doc version",

Notebook Magic Functions Jupyter notebook magic functions, also known as magics, are special commands that\n    provide notebook functions that might not be easy for you to program using Python. HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software supports line magics and cell magics. Jupyter notebook Magic functions , also known as magic commands or magics , are commands that you can execute within a code cell. Magics are not Python\n      code. They are shortcuts that extends the capabilities of a notebook. Magic commands start\n      with the % character. HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software supports built-in magic functions and the custom\n      magics that are described in this topic. HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software supports line\n      magics and cell magics. Line magic commands do not require a cell body and start with a single % character. Cell magic commands start with %% and require additional lines of input (a\n      cell body). To use these magic functions, you must create a notebook. See Creating and Managing Notebook Servers . %commands The %commands command lists the magic commands and SDKs that are\n        customized by Hewlett Packard Enterprise and are available in this\n          notebook. %createKernel The %createKernel command creates a custom Python kernel in the notebook. The custom Python kernel can be selected as the kernel for a notebook session to work\n        within a specific virtual environment with its own set of dependencies and configurations.\n        By using the custom Python kernel, you can isolate your Python packages and dependencies\n        from other projects or applications such that each project has its own environment and is\n        not affected by changes made to other environments. To create a custom Python kernel from conda package installation, perform: Enter the %createKernel command in a notebook. NOTE You can also directly enter packages as arguments with %createKernel magic function. For example: %createKernel pigz pandas Enter the name for your Python kernel in the Name box. In this\n            example, we use MyPython as the custom Python kernel name. Enter the conda package name in the Package 1 box. To enter\n            additional packages, click the + button. Click the Create Custom Python Kernel button. Click the New Launcher button. You can now see your custom Python kernel - MyPython kernel\n            among the available kernels. %manage_spark The %manage_spark command enables you to connect to the Livy server and\n        start a new Spark session. You must use Spark-related kernels such as\n          PySpark, Spark, or SparkR to use sparkmagic . When\n        you run the %manage_spark command in a notebook cell, a new user interface\n        (UI) widget is displayed, which allows you to configure and manage a Spark cluster. You can\n        use different tabs in this UI widget to manage sessions, create sessions, add endpoints, and\n        manage endpoints. Add Endpoint: To add endpoints, set the following boxes and then\n        click Add endpoint . Auth type: The default authentication for the internal Livy endpoint is Single\n              Sign-On. To connect to other Livy clusters, select the authentication type of your\n              choice. Address: Enter endpoint address. Create Session: To create sessions, set the following boxes and then\n        click Create Session . Endpoint: Select endpoint for your session. Name: Enter session name. Language: Choose either Scala or Python as a runtime. Properties: Edit the Spark configurations. %config_spark You can use the %config_spark magic command to customize the Spark jobs\n        submitted from the PySpark kernel. You can add or delete the Spark configurations when\n        submitting a Livy session. To customize the Spark configurations, follow these steps: Run %config_spark . Click the +Add Spark Configuration Key-Value Pair button. Enter the key and value for Spark configurations in their respective boxes. After you have finished adding the key-value pairs, click Submit . Restart the PySpark kernel and run %manage_spark to see the changes\n            applied in the Properties section of the Create\n              Session tab. You can also edit the values for other Spark configurations or delete any configurations\n        using this magic command. For example: To learn more about customizing Spark configurations when enabling the GPU\n        support for Livy sessions, see Enabling GPU Support for Livy Sessions Created Using Notebooks . %git_clone The %git_clone magic enables you to clone your private GitHub repository\n        from the notebook. To clone the repository, enter your GitHub username and GitHub password. After you have finished cloning the repository, you can use the Git extension in the notebook for version control. %sql and %%sql You can use the %sql magic command in Jupyter Notebook to interactively\n        work with SQL databases. To learn more about how to connect to databases, see connecting to a database . You must use Python kernels to use %sql and %%sql magic\n        commands. You can directly write and execute SQL queries within a notebook cell. When you\n        run the notebook cell containing %sql and your SQL query, the magic command\n        sends the query to the database, runs it, and retrieves the result. In HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software , you can connect to all SQL databases (if\n          you have public access to these databases) and submit queries\n        through EzPresto using the %sql magic as\n          follows: %sql SELECT * FROM cache.information_schema.columns NOTE If you have private access to SQL databases, you can not connect to those\n          databases through EzPresto using the %sql or %%sql magic. To learn how to establish a\n          connection to SQL databases and submit queries from a notebook when you have private\n          access to the database, see Submitting Presto Queries from Notebook . You can use the %%sql magic command to define and run an entire SQL script\n        or block. This means you can write and run a series of SQL statements in the same cell using %%sql magic. The results of the SQL query or queries are displayed in the notebook as a table that makes\n        it easy to analyze and visualize the data. Getting Help To display help about a magic command, enter the command followed by a ? (question mark). For example: %manage_spark?
