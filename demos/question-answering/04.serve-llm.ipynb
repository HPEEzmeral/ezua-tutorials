    "documents using Large Language Models (LLMs). In the previous Notebooks, you journeyed through the processes of creating\n",
    "vector embeddings of our documents, setting up a Vector Store Inference Service (ISVC), and testing its performance.\n",

    "# Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "In this setup, an additional component, called a \"transformer\", plays a pivotal role in processing user queries and\n",
    "integrating the Vector Store ISVC with the LLM ISVC. The transformer's role is to intercept the user's request, extract\n",
    "the necessary information, and then communicate with the Vector Store ISVC to retrieve the relevant context. The\n",
    "transformer then takes the response of the Vector Store ISVC (i.e., the context), combines it with the user's query, and\n",
    "forwards the enriched prompt to the LLM predictor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a detailed look at the process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Intercepting the User's Request: The transformer acts as a gateway between the user and the LLM ISVC. When a user\n",
    "   sends a query, it first reaches the transformer. The transformer extracts the query from the request.\n",
    "1. Communicating with the Vector Store ISVC: The transformer then takes the user's query and sends a POST request to the\n",
    "   Vector Store ISVC including the user's query in the payload, just like you did in the previous Notebook.\n",
    "1. Receiving and Processing the Context: The Vector Store ISVC responds by sending back the relevant context.\n",
    "1. Combining the Context with the User's Query: The transformer then combines the received context with the user's\n",
    "   original query using a prompt template. This creates an enriched prompt that contains both the user's original\n",
    "   question and the relevant context from our documents.\n",
    "1. Forwarding the Enriched Query to the LLM Predictor: Finally, the transformer forwards this enriched query to the LLM\n",
    "   predictor. The predictor then processes this query and generates a response, which is sent back to the transformer.\n",
    "   Steps 2 through 5 are transparent to the user.\n",
    "1. The transformer returns the response to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, you should build two custom Docker images at this point: one for the predictor and one for the transformer. The\n",
    "source code and the Dockerfiles are provided in the corresponding folders: `dockerfiles/llm` and\n",
    "`dockerfiles/transformer`. For your convenience, you can use the images we have pre-built for you:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Predictor: `dpoulopoulos/qna-predictor:v0.1.0`\n",
    "- Transformer: `dpoulopoulos/qna-transformer:v0.1.0`\n",
    "\n",
    "Once ready, proceed with the next steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating the Inference Service\n",

    "As before, you need to provide a few variables:\n",
