    "# Find Good Hyperparameter For News Recommendation System With Tune\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this example is to train a very simple news recommendation system, We will:\n",
    "- Prepare the training data in parallel with Ray\n",
    "- Train a simple model that classifies article titles as \"popular\" or \"less popular\" using scikit learn and\n",
    "- Find good hyperparameter settings for the model with Tune, Ray's parallel hyperparameter optimization library.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Downloading And Preparing The Training Data\n",
    "\n",
    "First we will download and uncompress 400,000 hackernews submissions. This is a small subset of the articles that have been submitted to https://news.ycombinator.com. The data includes the title of each submission and its score, which roughly corresponds to the number of upvotes. There are 4 batches of JSON files that contain the information, named `submission-1.json` through `submission-4.json`. The first couple lines of the first file will be printed below by the `head` command. Delete zip file as we have already extracted the required data."

    "Now let's try to improve these results by doing some hyperparameter tuning. Hyperparameter tuning is the process of finding the best parameters for the learning algorithm. These parameters are typically few numbers like learning rate schedule (i.e. how large steps to take in each iteration), regularization parameters or size of the model. By tuning these knobs, we can typically make the model perform better. Tune supports a number of different algorithms to perform hyperparameter tuning. The simplest is a grid search where we just exhaustively try out different values for the parameters. More sophisticated algorithms include hyperband and population based training. If you want to learn more about these, check out the [tune documentation](https://ray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tune.html). "
